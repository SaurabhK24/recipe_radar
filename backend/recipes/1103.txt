Ingredients:
15g/1oz unsalted butter
2 small red onions, sliced
2 rashers back bacon, sliced thinly
olive oil
4 x 170g/6oz salmon steaks
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 small savoy cabbage , core removed and shredded

For the dressing

2 tbsp grainy mustard
Â½ lemon, juice only
1 tsp chopped parsley
1 tbsp white wine vinegar

Instructions:
Heat the butter in a large pan, add the onion and fry gently for five minutes.
Brush each side of the salmon with olive oil. Heat a non-stick frying pan, when hot add the salmon and leave to seal in the pan. Turn over halfway through cooking.
Add the shredded cabbage to the bacon and onions and stir. Cover with a tight fitting lid and continue to cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. This will ensure the cabbage will absorb the butter and retain moisture.
Combine all the dressing ingredients together in a jar with a tight-fitting lid and shake to combine thoroughly. (You can also do this in a bowl with a fork.)
At the end of cooking, season, then serve in a large bowl placing the salmon on top. Spoon the dressing around the edge.
