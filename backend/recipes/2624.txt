Ingredients:

For the chicken

Â½ chicken breast, skinned
55g/2oz Somerset goats' cheese
small handful fresh basil, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil

For the pan-roasted balsamic tomatoes

1 tbsp olive oil
2 vine tomatoes, halved
2 tsp balsamic vinegar
salt and freshly ground black pepper
chopped fresh chives, to garnish

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
Place the chicken breast onto a board, cover with a piece of cling film and then bash with a meat mallet until it is flattened slightly.
Mix the goats' cheese with the chopped basil and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spoon the mixture into the middle of the flattened chicken. Roll up and secure with a cocktail stick.
Heat the olive oil in an ovenproof frying pan, add the stuffed chicken breast and brown on all sides. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook for 5-8 or until the chicken is cooked through.
For the pan-roasted tomatoes, place the cut side of the tomatoes down into a non-stick frying pan with a drizzle of olive oil and fry for 2-3 minutes.
Turn the tomatoes over, add the balsamic vinegar and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook for 1-2 minutes.
To serve, place the roasted tomatoes onto a serving plate, top with the stuffed chicken and garnish with chives.
