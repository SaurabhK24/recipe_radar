Ingredients:

For the frittata

2 tbsp olive oil
¼ onion, finely chopped
½ red pepper from a jar, cut into strips
55g/2oz black olives, chopped
55g/2oz smoked salmon, chopped
4 free-range eggs, beaten
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the dressing

2 red peppers from a jar
1 tbsp black olives
2 tbsp capers, drained
3 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp white wine vinegar
½ lemon, juice only
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
To serve

2 tbsp Greek-style yoghurt
2 tbsp capers, drained, then fried until crisp

Instructions:
Preheat the grill to medium.
For the frittata, heat the olive oil in an ovenproof frying pan and fry the onion and pepper for 2-4 minutes, or until softened. Add the olives and salmon and stir well to combine.
Pour the beaten egg into the pan and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Continue to cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the egg is almost set, then place under the grill for 2-3 minutes to finish cooking.
For the dressing, place all of the ingredients into a food processor and blend until smooth.
Turn the frittata out onto a serving plate and cut into wedges. Drizzle with some of the dressing, spoon over the yoghurt and scatter the capers over the top to serve.
