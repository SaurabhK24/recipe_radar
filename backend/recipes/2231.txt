Ingredients:
3 fresh chorizo sausages, sliced into rounds the thickness of a pound coin
4 spring onions, trimmed and sliced
2 red chillies, thickly sliced
24 scallops, cleaned (with 6 shells reserved and cleaned if you can get them)
2 tbsp runny honey

Instructions:
Heat a heavy griddle pan over a high heat. Fry the chorizo until it is browned and some of the juices are running in the pan. Add the spring onion and chilli and fry for 2-3 minutes.
Add the scallops and fry for 2-3 minutes on either side or until cooked through. Drizzle over the runny honey and stir to coat. Divide the scallops and chorizo among the six scallop shells and serve.
