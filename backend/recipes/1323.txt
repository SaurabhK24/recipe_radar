Author: Gino D'Acampo

Ingredients:

For the steak

100g/3½oz rump steak
1 tbsp olive oil
3 tbsp balsamic vinegar
3 tbsp clear honey

For the potatoes

1 potato, peeled, cut into 1cm/½in slices, blanched
1 tbsp olive oil

For the rosemary oil

2 tbsp olive oil
1 sprig fresh rosemary

For the spinach

25g/1oz unsalted butter
1 tbsp olive oil
55g/2oz spinach
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
Rub the steak with the oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper on both sides.
Heat a frying pan until smoking. Add the beef and fry for two minutes on each side.
Add the balsamic vinegar and reduce by half.
Add the honey and cook for a further minute. Remove the beef rest for 2-3 minutes and then slice.
For the potatoes, heat the olive oil in an ovenproof frying pan. Add the potato slices and fry for two minutes on each side, until crisp and golden. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and transfer to the oven to roast for five minutes.
For the rosemary oil, gently heat the olive oil and rosemary in a frying pan for 1-2 minutes, then remove from the heat and leave to infuse for five minutes.
For the spinach, melt the butter with the olive oil in a large pan, then add the spinach. Cook until the spinach has wilted down, then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Squeeze out the excess moisture and place onto a plate.
Serve the sliced beef with the spinach and drizzle the pan juices over the top. Arrange the potatoes alongside and spoon over some of the rosemary oil.
