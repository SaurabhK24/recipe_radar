Ingredients:
150g/5½oz peeled cooked prawns
pinch chilli powder
½ lime, juice only
1 free-range egg yolk
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp sesame seeds
1 tbsp olive oil
1 thick slice bread
1 handful cherry tomatoes

Instructions:
Place the prawns, chilli powder, lime juice, egg and oil into a food processor and blend to a coarse paste.
In a hot frying pan toast the bread on one side, then turn over and lightly toast for one minute.
Spread the prawn mixture onto the lightly toasted side, sprinkle with the sesame seeds and turn over to fry prawn-side down for 2-3 minutes, until golden.
To serve, cut up the prawn toast into 'soldiers' and place onto a plate with some cherry tomatoes alongside.
