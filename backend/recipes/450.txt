For the bulgar wheat salad

110g/4oz bulgar wheat
55g/2oz raisins
1½ oranges, juice only
squeeze lime juice
1 tbsp hemp seeds (available from health food stores)
½ red onion, peeled and finely chopped
pinch chilli powder

For the poussin

Instructions:
For the salad, place the bulgar wheat in a large bowl. Pour over enough boiling water to cover and then cover with foil. Leave to rest for 10 minutes to steam.
Add the raisins, orange juice and a squeeze of lime juice and stir together.
Add the hemp seeds, red onion, chilli powder and soy sauce and cover with foil again until ready to serve.
For the poussin, half-fill a pan with water. Add the garlic cloves and mixed herbs. Bring to a simmer and place a steamer on top.
Place the poussin breasts into the steamer, cover with a lid and steam for 6-8 minutes, or until the poussin is cooked through.
To serve, spoon the bulgar wheat salad onto a warm plate and place the steamed poussin on top.
