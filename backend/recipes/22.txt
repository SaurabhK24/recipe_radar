Ingredients:

For the salad

4 cucumbers, peeled, seeds removed, cut into 5cm/2in long batons
large pinch salt
100ml/3½oz groundnut oil
1 tsp chilli oil
1 garlic clove, crushed
Small red chilli, seeds removed, chopped
25g/1oz sugar
1 tsp Sichuan peppercorns, roasted in a dry frying pan, crushed
0.5cm/quarter in piece fresh ginger, peeled, cut into matchsticks
30ml/1fl oz rice wine vinegar
2 spring onions, finely chopped
220g/7½oz bamboo shoots from a can, rinsed and drained
100g/3½oz mangetout, finely sliced
2 tbsp bean sprouts

For the steak

1 tbsp Sichuan peppercorns, roasted in a dry frying pan, crushed
4 x 200g/7oz beef fillet steaks
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tbsp sesame seeds
fresh coriander leaves, to garnish

Instructions:
For the salad, place the cucumber batons into a colander and sprinkle with salt, tossing to cover evenly. Leave to drain for 20-25 minutes, to remove excess moisture, then rinse in cold water and pat dry.
In a small saucepan warm the groundnut oil and chilli oil. Add the garlic and chilli and warm for a minute.
Add the sugar, Sichuan peppercorns, ginger and rice wine vinegar, bring to the boil and simmer for five minutes.
Add the cucumber and spring onions, increase the heat to high and boil for 10-15 seconds. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to go completely cold.
When the liquid is cold, add the bamboo shoots, mangetout and bean sprouts.
For the steak, season the steaks with salt. Brush the steaks with vegetable oil and then dip into the peppercorns to coat.
Fry the steaks in a very hot frying pan for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking.
Remove the steak from the pan and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Allow to rest for five minutes, then cut into slices.
To serve, place spoonfuls of the salad onto plates and top with slices of beef. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.
