Ingredients:

For the pilaff

1 tbsp olive oil
½ onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
½ tsp ground turmeric
½ tsp ground cumin
200g/7oz long grain rice
400ml/¾ pint vegetable stock
25g/1oz butter
1 tbsp chopped fresh basil, plus a sprig to garnish

For the meatballs

¼ onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
150g/5½oz minced beef
½ tsp cumin seeds
½ tsp freshly grated nutmeg
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp chopped fresh mint
2 tbsp olive oil

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
For the pilaff, heat the oil in an ovenproof pan and fry the onion and garlic for 4-5 minutes. Add the turmeric, cumin and rice and stir to coat well. Pour in the stock, put on the lid and transfer to the oven to cook through for about ten minutes. Remove from the oven and stir in the butter and basil.
For the meatballs, place all of the ingredients except for the olive oil in a bowl and mix well. Using your hands, take walnut-sized pieces of the mixture and form balls.
Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the meatballs for 5-6 minutes, or until coloured on all sides and completely cooked through.
To serve, stir all but two of the meatballs into the pilaff and spoon onto a serving plate. Arrange the remaining meatballs on top and garnish with a sprig of fresh basil.
