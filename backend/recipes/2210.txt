Author: José Pizarro

Ingredients:
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 banana shallot, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
50g/1¾oz caramelised onions
400g/14oz free-range chicken livers
2 tbsp sherry vinegar
2 tbsp salted capers, rinsed
5 sprigs flatleaf parsley, leaves picked and chopped
4 slices good-quality bread
1 small red onion, finely sliced
4 sprigs mint, leaves picked and chopped
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Heat the oil in a frying pan and gently fry the shallot, garlic and caramelised onions until soft. Add the livers, season with salt and pepper, and fry for 4 minutes.
Pour in the vinegar and cook for 3 minutes, by which time the vinegar smell should have disappeared. To check the livers are cooked through, remove a piece of liver from the pan and cut it open; it should be moist but no longer bloody (a little tinge of pink is fine). When the livers are cooked, stir in the capers and parsley and remove from the heat.
Toast the bread and cut each slice in half, making two triangles. Arrange on plates and top with the livers. Garnish with a scattering of red onion and chopped mint and serve.
