Add the chicken and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until lightly golden, then add the rice wine or sherry and stir well. Stir fry for a few seconds, then add the dried Chinese mushrooms and carrot and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes, or until the carrots are tender but with a bit of bite.
Add the gherkins, dried wood ear mushrooms, bamboo shoots and peanuts and mix well. Stir in the scrambled eggs. Season with the soy sauce, sesame oil and pepper and transfer to a serving dish.
To serve, place the dish in the centre of the table together with the lettuce leaves. Stuff each lettuce leaf with the filling and eat immediately.
