Ingredients:

For the roulade

handful chopped fresh herbs, such as parsley, chives, basil
Â½ lemon, juice only
freshly ground black pepper

For the dill yoghurt

2 tbsp Greek-style yoghurt
2 tsp chopped fresh dill
To serve

2 cherry tomatoes, halved
1 tbsp olive oil

Instructions:
For the roulade, place the smoked salmon slices onto a sheet of cling film. Sprinkle over the chopped herbs and lemon juice, season with freshly ground black pepper and roll up. Wrap the cling film around the salmon to secure it and place in the fridge for five minutes to firm up. Remove the cling film and cut into slices.
For the dill yoghurt, place the yoghurt into a bowl with the dill and mix well.
To serve, place the roulade slices onto a serving plate with a dollop of dill yoghurt. Garnish with cherry tomatoes and drizzle with olive oil.
