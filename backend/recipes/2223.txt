Ingredients:
100ml/3Â½fl oz olive oil
8 pieces cooking chorizo, cut into rounds the same size as the scallops
30ml/1fl oz dry sherry
1 orange or lemon, zest and juice
1 tsp Tabasco sauce
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley

For the scallops

8 scallops, roe removed
salt and freshly ground black pepper
8 peas

Instructions:
Heat one tablespoon of the olive oil in a pan and add the chorizo slices. Fry for 1-2 minutes on each side, until crisp and golden-brown.
Add the sherry and boil until the volume of liquid has reduced by half. Remove the chorizo pieces from the pan, set aside and keep warm.
Add the remaining olive oil, orange or lemon juice and zest and the Tabasco sauce. Stir to warm through, then add the chopped parsley.Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.
For the scallops, season the scallops with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Heat a separate pan until smoking hot. Rub the scallops with a little olive oil and fry in the pan for one minute on each side, or until just cooked through. Pat the scallops dry with kitchen paper.
To serve, thread a piece of chorizo onto a cocktail stick, followed by one scallop and one pea. Repeat with all of the chorizo pieces, scallops and peas.
Place the skewers onto a plate, drizzle with the pan juices and serve.
