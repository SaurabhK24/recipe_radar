Ingredients:
400g/14oz Sardinian gnocchetti (or pasta of your choice)
salt

For the sauce

6 tbsp olive oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
300g/10½oz fresh Italian sausage (luganega), meat removed from the casing and crumbled
35g/1¼oz dried porcini, soaked in water for half an hour, then finely chopped (keep the liquid)
3 tbsp dry white wine
600g/1lb 5oz polpa di pomodoro (crushed tomatoes)
salt and pepper, to taste

Instructions:
For the sauce, heat the oil in a casserole, add the onion, and let it cook for 5 minutes over a moderate heat until softened.
Add the garlic and cook for another minute before adding the sausage and porcini.
Allow to brown, stirring, then pour in the wine and the tomato pulp.
Leave to cook over a very low heat for about 1 hour.
If more moisture is needed, add a little of the mushroom soaking liquid.
When ready, season to taste with salt and pepper.
Cook the pasta in plenty of boiling salted water until al dente, about 10-12 minutes.
Mix the pasta with the sauce and serve immediately.
