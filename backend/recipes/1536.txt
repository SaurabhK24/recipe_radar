Ingredients:
2 chicken breasts, skin off
3 large zucchinis (courgettes), sliced ½cm/¼in thick
4 cloves garlic, chopped roughly
extra virgin olive oil
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
290ml/½ pint water or chicken stock
50g/2oz softened butter

Instructions:
Heat plenty of extra virgin olive oil in a large frying pan.
Add the garlic and sea salt, and fry for a couple of minutes.
Add the zucchini and a touch more salt, and continue frying, stirring continuously to get the zucchinis moving.
Add the water or stock and allow to simmer for 2 or 3 minutes, until the zucchini is well softened.
Remove half the zucchini from the pan and blend roughly with the butter. Return this to the pan and add pepper, salt and a dash more olive oil.
Meanwhile, sprinkle the chicken breasts well with salt and extra virgin olive oil and char-grill for a couple of minutes on each side to produce a criss-cross effect. Be sure to add another dash of salt to the chicken breasts when you turn them. This melts into the meat as it rests. Rest the chicken breasts for 2 minutes.
To serve, spoon the zucchini sauce onto serving plates and place the chicken over the top with a dash of extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkling of freshly ground black pepper.
