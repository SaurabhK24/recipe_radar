Ingredients:

For the salad

1 tbsp olive oil
85g/3oz chicken breast
55g/2oz tinned chickpeas, drained
5 cherry tomatoes, halved
¼ mango, peeled, cut into small pieces
½ orange, zest only
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
1 tbsp chopped fresh chervil
1 tbsp chopped fresh basil

For the herb oil

2 tbsp chopped fresh mint
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
3 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
To serve

handful fresh spinach leaves

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
Heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan and fry the chicken for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown. Add the chickpeas and cook for a further 1-2 minutes. Transfer to the oven and roast for 5-7 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. (The chicken is cooked through when the juices run clear when pierced in the thickest part with a skewer.) Remove the chicken breast and chickpeas from the oven and shred the chicken breast.
Mix the remaining salad ingredients in a bowl with shredded chicken and chickpeas.
For the herb oil, blend all the ingredients in a food processor until smooth.
To serve, place the spinach leaves on a serving plate, top with the salad and spoon the herb oil on top.
