dash olive oil
¼ onion, finely sliced
200g/7oz boerewors (South African) sausage, or other spiced sausage

splash boiling water
large handful fresh spinach leaves

Instructions:
Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onion and fry until softened.
Chop half of the sausage and add to the frying pan. Add the rice and a splash of boiling water and stir until the water is absorbed.
Add the spinach leaves and chilli and stir well until the spinach leaves are beginning to wilt.
In a separate pan, fry the rest of the sausage until golden-brown all over and cooked through.
