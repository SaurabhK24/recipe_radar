Ingredients:
2 tbsp black mustard seeds
4–6 tbsp mustard oil or vegetable oil
1 onion, thinly sliced
1 tsp ground turmeric
250ml/9fl oz coconut milk
250g/9oz fresh or frozen coconut flesh, blitzed in a food processor or grated
1 tsp salt
350g/12oz peeled raw prawns
4 fresh green chillies, with seeds, cut lengthways into sixths
handful chopped coriander, to finish

Instructions:
Put the mustard seeds into a mini-food processor and add two tablespoons of water. Blend for a minute and then add another two tablespoons of water and continue blending until the seeds start to break up (this can take a minute or two of persistent blending; add more water if you’re having trouble). Keep blending until you have a rough paste that resembles wholegrain mustard, adding a splash more water if needed. Set aside.
Heat the mustard or vegetable oil in a heavy-based saucepan or karahi over a low-medium heat. Add the onion and fry for 10 minutes. Add the blended mustard paste, turmeric, coconut milk, grated coconut and salt. Bring to a boil then simmer for 4-5 minutes.
Add the prawns and green chillies and simmer for a further 3-4 minutes, or until the prawns are pink and cooked through. Scatter with coriander and serve.
