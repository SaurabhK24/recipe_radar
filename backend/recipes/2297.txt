freshly ground black pepper
squeeze of lemon juice

For the salad

½ red chilli, de-seeded and sliced

2 tbsp olive oil

For the sauce

1 tbsp olive oil
½ red onion, sliced
½ red chilli, de-seeded and sliced
55g/2oz mangetout, sliced

Instructions:
Heat a non-stick frying pan until hot.
Sear the tuna steak for 45 seconds to one minute on each side. Season with salt and pepper, remove the pan from the heat and carefully add the lemon juice (caution: this may flame). Allow to rest.
To make the salad, place the chilli, tomato, mangetout and onion in a large bowl.
Add the olive oil and toss together to coat.
To make the sauce, heat the oil in a frying pan and gently sauté the onion for 1-2 minutes, to soften.
Add the chilli, mangetout and tomato and sauté for a further 2-3 minutes.
To serve, transfer the tuna steak to a serving plate and serve the salad alongside.
Drizzle the sauce around the edge and serve.
