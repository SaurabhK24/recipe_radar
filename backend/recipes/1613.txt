salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the red pepper and aubergine

3 tbsp olive oil
½ red pepper, seeds removed, halved
salt and freshly ground black pepper
½ aubergine, sliced
2 garlic cloves, chopped

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
For the fish, heat the oil in a frying pan and season the fish with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fry the fish for 2-3 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown and cooked through.
For the red pepper, drizzle a tablespoon of the olive oil over the pepper halves and fry in a hot frying pan for 3-4 minutes, or until the skin is blistered. Transfer to the oven to roast for 10-12 minutes, or until tender.
