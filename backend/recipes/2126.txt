Author: James Tanner

Ingredients:
15g/¼oz butter
100g/3½oz spinach
1 sheet ready-made puff pastry, rolled out to ½cm/¼in thickness
100g/3½oz salmon fillet
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 free-range egg, lightly whisked

For the fresh parsley sauce

15g/¼oz butter
15g¼oz flour
2 tbsp double cream
small handful fresh parsley, chopped

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
Heat the butter in a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the spinach and cook for 2-3 minutes, until wilted down.
Lay out pastry onto an oiled baking sheet and place the spinach into the centre, leaving a clean edge.
Place the salmon on top of spinach and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Brush the clear edges of pastry with the whisked egg and fold up the pastry to make a parcel, pressing down onto the edges with a fork to seal the parcel.
Transfer to the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the pastry is risen and golden and the salmon is completely cooked through.
For the fresh parsley sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the flour and stir well for one minute, then add the cream, stirring well to form a smooth sauce.
Add the fresh parsley and cook for another minute, until warmed through.
To serve, slice the salmon parcel diagonally, place onto a plate and drizzle with fresh parsley sauce.
