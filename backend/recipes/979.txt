Author: Justine Pattison

Ingredients:
2 tbsp sunflower oil
2 large red onions, thinly sliced
50g/1Â¾oz piece fresh root ginger, peeled, finely grated
4 garlic cloves, crushed
1 tsp dried chilli flakes
500g/1lb 2oz braising steak, trimmed, cut into 5cm/2in cubes
2 tsp Chinese five-spice powder
350ml/12fl oz hot beef stock (made with 1 stock cube)
4 tbsp dark soy sauce
4 tsp cornflour
2 tbsp clear honey
freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Heat the oil in a large, heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onions and fry for 8-10 minutes, stirring regularly, until softened and lightly browned. Add the ginger, garlic and chilli flakes, stir well and cook for 2-3 minutes, making sure the garlic doesn't burn.
Season the beef all over with pepper, then sprinkle over the five-spice powder and mix to coat evenly. Add to the pan and fry for 3-4 minutes, turning the beef regularly until lightly browned all over.
Transfer to the slow-cooker. Pour over the stock and stir in the soy sauce. Cover and cook on high for 4 hours, until the beef is meltingly tender.
When the beef is cooked, whisk the cornflour with 1 tablespoon water to a smooth paste, stir in the honey. Add to the slow-cooker, cover and cook for 12-15 minutes, or until the sauce is glossy and has thickened slightly.
Serve the beef with steamed rice or boiled noodles and stir-fried vegetables.
