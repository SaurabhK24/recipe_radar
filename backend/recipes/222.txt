Ingredients:
2 tbsp flour
salt and freshly ground black pepper
12 pork cheeks, trimmed
2 tbsp olive oil
3 banana shallots, finely sliced
2 leeks, finely sliced
50g/2oz unsalted butter
30g/1oz runny honey
1 tbsp picked fresh thyme
200ml/7fl oz white wine
200ml/7fl oz chicken stock
1 tbsp wholegrain mustard
100ml/3½fl oz double cream
400g/14oz tinned butter beans, rinsed and drained
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar

Instructions:
Combine the flour with the salt and black pepper in a shallow bowl. Dust the pork cheeks all over with the seasoned flour.
Heat one tablespoon of oil in a large deep pan over a medium heat and fry the pork cheeks for 2-3 minutes, or until browned on all sides. Remove the pork from the pan and set aside.
In the same pan heat the remaining olive oil and add the shallots and leeks. Add the butter and fry for 5-6 minutes. Add the honey and stir to coat the vegetables.
Return the pork cheeks to the pan and add the thyme, white wine and chicken stock. Reduce the heat and simmer on a very low heat, covered, for 2½ hours.
Remove the pork cheeks from the pan and set aside to rest. Add the mustard, cream, butter beans and vinegar, cooking for a further 5-6 minutes.
Return the cheeks to the pan to coat in the sauce, then serve with mash or rice.
