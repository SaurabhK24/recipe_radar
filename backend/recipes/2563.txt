Ingredients:
2 slices baguette
3 tbsp olive oil
1 garlic clove, peeled
170g/6oz rump steak
½ onion, finely sliced
1 tbsp Dijon mustard
75ml/2½fl oz double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp butter

Instructions:
Drizzle one side of the baguette slices with one tablespoon of the olive oil and place oiled-side down in a hot griddle pan until toasted. Rub the toasted side with the garlic.
Heat another tablespoon of oil in a non-stick frying pan and fry the steak for 4-6 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking. Set aside to rest in a warm place for a few minutes.
Add the last tablespoon of oil to the pan and fry the onion until soft.
Add the mustard and cream and simmer for 2-3 minutes, until slightly thickened. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and whisk in the butter.
To serve, place the steak between the baguette slices on a plate with a spoonful of the onions.
