Instructions:
For the soy and honey pork, heat the olive oil in a frying pan and cook the onion for 2-3 minutes, or until softened. Add the garlic and fry for one minute, then add the pork and stir-fry until golden-brown all over.
Drizzle over the soy sauce, honey, lime zest and juice and a splash of boiling water and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the pork is cooked through. Set aside.
