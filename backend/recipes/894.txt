Ingredients:

For the dumplings

2 duck sausages, skinned
½ tsp chilli powder
pinch paprika
25g/1oz Wensleydale cheese
3 large savoy cabbage leaves

For the sauce

¼ red onion, thinly sliced
pinch paprika
1 tbsp ketchup
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp sesame oil

Instructions:
Mix together the sausage meat with the chilli powder, paprika and Wensleydale in a bowl. Form into six balls, each the size of a golf ball.
Meanwhile, blanch the cabbage leaves in boiling water for 3-4 minutes and then remove and drain on kitchen towels.
Cut each leaf in half and wrap a cabbage leaf half around each duck ball. Secure with cocktail sticks if necessary.
Place the cabbage-wrapped balls into a bamboo steamer placed over a pan of simmering water. Cover and steam for 5-8 minutes, or until thoroughly cooked.
For the sauce, heat together the sauce ingredients in a small pan for five minutes.
To serve place the steamed sausage parcels on a plate with the sauce poured over.
