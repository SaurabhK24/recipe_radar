Place the chicken thighs, skin-side down, into the pan and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until the skin begins to brown.
Add the sliced bacon, turn the thighs over, and cook for a further 2-3 minutes, or until the bacon begins to colour.
Add the apples and allow to soften for one minute.
Pour in the cider and season with a pinch of salt. Cover with a lid and simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken juices run clear.
Serve immediately, taking the pot to the table and allowing people to help themselves.
