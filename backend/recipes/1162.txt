Ingredients:

For the stuffed chicken

1 sprig fresh rosemary, chopped
small handful fresh parsley, chopped
½ garlic clove, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 chicken drumstick
dash olive oil

For the crushed potatoes

10 new potatoes, peeled and halved
¼ onion, finely diced
2 tbsp butter
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives
salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 tbsp double cream

For the red wine sauce

dash olive oil
55g/2oz cherry tomatoes
3 tbsp red wine
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
small handful broccoli, cut into florets, steamed, to serve

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
For the chicken, mix the herbs, garlic and seasoning together in a bowl then push the mixture under the skin of the chicken drumstick.
Heat a dash of olive oil in an ovenproof frying pan, add the chicken and fry for four minutes. Turn over and place in a hot oven for ten minutes, or until the juices are clear when you stick the tip of a knife into the chicken and it's completely cooked through.
For the potatoes, boil the potatoes in salted boiling water for ten minutes or until soft. Drain well, add the onion, butter, chives, salt and freshly ground black pepper and double cream and mash until smooth.
For the sauce, pour a splash of olive oil into a clean frying pan. Add the cherry tomatoes and fry for five minutes. Add the red wine and balsamic vinegar to the pan and simmer for one minute.
To serve, pile the crushed potatoes onto a serving plate, top with the chicken drumstick and pour the red wine sauce over the top. Serve with the steamed broccoli.
