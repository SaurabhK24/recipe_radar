Cook time: 10 to 30 mins
Serves: 8
Author: Giancarlo Caldesi

Ingredients:
600g/1lb 5oz rigatoni or penne pasta
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 white onion, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, lightly crushed but left whole
salt and freshly ground black pepper
100ml/3½fl oz chilli-flavoured vodka
300g/10½oz hot smoked salmon (see 'Top recipe tip' below)
600ml/20fl oz double cream
2 tbsp roughly chopped fresh parsley, to serve

Instructions:
Put the pasta in a large pan filled with boiling salted water and boil according to packet instructions.
Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large frying pan and fry the onion and garlic over a medium heat until soft, but not coloured – about five minutes.
Add a pinch of salt, bearing in mind that the salmon will be salty already, and a generous pinch of black pepper.
Pour in the chilli vodka and ignite if you wish (take care to stand back until any flames have subsided) or simply leave for a couple of minutes to burn off the alcohol.
Flake the salmon into the pan and pour in the cream. Cook over a low heat until the sauce has thickened and the pasta is al dente.
Drain the pasta through a colander and add it to the pan with the salmon and cream. Toss through gently so as not to break up the salmon further and serve with a sprinkling of fresh parsley.
