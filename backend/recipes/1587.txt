Ingredients:

For the salmon

1 tbsp olive oil
1x110g/4oz thin salmon fillet, skin on
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
2 tsp clear honey
2 tsp sesame seeds

For the cheese and rocket mash

1 small potato, peeled and diced
25g/1oz butter
2 tbsp double cream
2 tbsp cheddar cheese, grated
35g/1Â¼oz rocket, chopped

Instructions:
For the salmon, heat the oil in a frying pan over a high heat. When hot add the salmon and pan fry for 1-2 minutes on each side.
Keeping the salmon in the pan, drain the oil from the pan and add the balsamic vinegar and cook for two minutes.
Finally add the honey and the sesame seeds. Remove the salmon from the pan. To make a sauce, add one tablespoon of hot water to the frying pan and stir well to remove the sticky bits from the bottom of the pan.
For the mash, bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil. Boil the potatoes for ten minutes.
Drain the potatoes and place into a bowl with the butter, cream, cheese and rocket and mash together.
To serve, place the mash onto a serving plate with the salmon on top. Drizzle with the sauce.
