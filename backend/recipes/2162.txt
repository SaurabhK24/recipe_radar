Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 green pepper, chopped
1 whole dried chilli
1 whole head of garlic cut into half across the middle
1 bunch coriander, chopped
1 small handful marjoram, chopped
100g/3Â½oz smoked bacon, or smoked turkey
500g/1lb 2oz dried black beans, soaked overnight
1 chicken stock cube
2 big pinches sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
coriander and marjoram, chopped, to serve

Instructions:
Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the onion, pepper, chilli, garlic, herbs and bacon or turkey and cook until the onions and peppers are softened, about 5-10 minutes.
Add the black beans, crumble in the stock cube and add enough water to cover. Reduce heat and simmer gently for 2-3 hours.
When the beans have a stew-like consistency they are ready. Season to taste with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Remove any branches of herbs and the hunk of bacon, before dishing up. To serve, garnish with chopped coriander and marjoram.
