1 tbsp vegetable oil
2 tbsp finely chopped onion
1 tsp freshly grated root ginger
1 red chilli, chopped
1 tsp Tabasco sauce
2 tbsp soy sauce
To serve

1 sprig fresh dill

Instructions:
For the sashimi, arrange the fish slices on a plate and cover with cling film. Place into the freezer to chill for 8-10 minutes, then remove and sprinkle over the salt and oil.
For the dressing, heat the oil in a pan and gently fry the onion, ginger and chilli for 2-3 minutes, or until softened. Stir in the Tabasco and soy sauce and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half.
