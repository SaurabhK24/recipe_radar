Reduce the heat, add the remaining oil to the pan and fry the shallots and the garlic for 2-3 minutes, or until they begin to soften. Stir in the morels and fry for 1-2 minutes, then season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Pour in the wine and stir in the chopped thyme leaves, then leave to simmer for 5-6 minutes, or until the liquid has thickened.
Pour the mushroom and red wine sauce over the steaks and serve.
