Ingredients:

For the chutney

75g/2⅔oz caster sugar
25g/1oz sultanas
few sprigs fresh rosemary
2cm/¾in piece root ginger, peeled and finely chopped
1 shallot, peeled and finely chopped
3 sticks rhubarb
5 tbsp cider vinegar
1 orange, juice only
salt and black pepper

For the mackerel

2 whole mackerel, gutted, filleted and pin boned
rapeseed oil, for cooking

For the salad

1 orange, segmented
2 heads chicory, separated into leaves
100g/3½oz pea shoots
small handful celery tops
1 tbsp chopped fresh dill
rapeseed oil, for dressing
salt and black pepper

For the garnish

1 stick rhubarb, sliced into ribbons using a vegetable peeler

Instructions:
For the chutney, in a heavy-based pan melt the sugar until a golden-brown caramel forms. Remove from the heat and stir in the sultanas, rosemary sprigs, ginger, shallot and rhubarb.
Stir in the cider vinegar and orange juice. Bring back to the boil and cook gently for 8-10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and set aside to cool.
To make the salad, mix together the orange segments, chicory leaves, pea shoots, celery tops and dill. Dress with rapeseed oil and season with salt and pepper.
For the mackerel, place the mackerel fillets skin-side up on an oven tray. Brush with rapeseed oil and use a blow torch to cook evenly. Turn over and repeat on the other side (alternatively place the fillets under a hot grill). Season with salt and pepper.
Serve a spoonful of chutney with the cooked mackerel fillets and salad. Garnish with ribbons of rhubarb.
