Ingredients:

For the pancakes

110g/4oz self-raising flour
pinch salt
1 free-range egg, beaten
1 free-range egg yolk
150ml/¼ pint milk
1 spring onion, chopped
6 new potatoes, peeled and grated
1 tbsp olive oil

For the cream cheese topping

100g/3½oz cream cheese
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
To serve

2 slices smoked salmon
few sprigs fresh dill

Instructions:
For the pancakes, place the flour into a large bowl, add the salt, the beaten egg and the egg yolk and mix well. Gradually whisk in the milk to make a smooth batter.
Add the spring onions and grated potatoes to the batter and stir well.
Heat half of the olive oil in a frying pan and remove the excess with kitchen paper. Pour in spoonfuls of the batter and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden-brown on both sides. Remove the pancakes from the pan and keep warm. Repeat the process with the remaining oil and batter.
For the cream cheese topping, place the cream cheese, chives and parsley into a small bowl and mix well.
To serve, place the pancakes onto serving plates and top with the cream cheese mixture and the salmon slices. Garnish with fresh dill.
