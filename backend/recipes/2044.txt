Ingredients:

For the pork

400g/14oz pork fillet, fully trimmed
1 tbsp pimenton (or smoked paprika)
2 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the sauce

2 tbsp olive oil
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 tbsp fresh rosemary, finely chopped
200g/7oz semi-cured chorizo, peeled and finely chopped
1 tbsp pimenton (or smoked paprika)
150g/5½oz white Spanish beans
150g/5½oz woodfire roasted red peppers, chopped
150ml/5fl oz double cream
To serve

2 tbsp parsley oil
200ml/7fl oz veal jus or reduced beef or veal stock, warmed
2 tbsp parsley cress

Instructions:
For the pork, preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.
Season the pork fillet with the pimenton, salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Heat an ovenproof frying pan until hot, add the oil, then the pork fillet and sear until golden-brown on all sides (about 30-45 seconds on each side). Transfer the pan to the oven and roast for 6-8 minutes. Remove from the oven and rest for 5 minutes in the pan before serving.
For the sauce, heat the oil in a pan, add the garlic, rosemary and chorizo. Cook until the chorizo is crisp and has released its oil. Add the pimenton, beans and peppers and cook for a 2-3 minutes. Add the cream and cook until the volume of the sauce has reduced by half.
To serve, place the sauce in the centre of serving bowls. Slice the fillet and place on top. Garnish with the herb oil, parsley cress and warm jus.
