Ingredients:
6 small preserved lemons
7½cm/3in piece fresh root ginger, peeled and grated
1 tbsp grated fresh turmeric
2 tbps olive oil
1 fat garlic clove, peeled
5 tbsp clear honey
black pepper
2 tbsp olive oil
4 extra-large prawns (about 100g/3½oz each, if possible)

Instructions:
In a blender, combine all the ingredients except the prawns and blend to a purée.
Peel the prawns, but leave the tail on. Pour the marinade into a shallow bowl or a large food bag, add the prawns and make sure they are well-coated. Refrigerate for at least 20 minutes, but longer if you like.
Heat a large griddle pan. When hot, add the prawns and cook on each side for 1-2 minutes, or until cooked through. While they are cooking keep basting all the time. Serve immediately.
