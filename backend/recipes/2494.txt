Ingredients:

For the prawns

5 large prawns, peeled and heads removed, butterflied
large piece fresh ginger
1 lime, zest and juice only
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 garlic clove, chopped
1 fresh green chilli, chopped
dash of vegetable oil
1 tbsp grated fresh coconut
large handful fresh spinach

For the caramelised onion

1 tbsp vegetable oil
Â½ onion, finely sliced
To serve

1 tbsp toasted pine nuts
handful fresh coriander leaves, to garnish

Instructions:
For the prawns, place the butterflied prawns in a bowl. Grate the ginger into a clean tea towel or cloth and twist to squeeze the juice onto the prawns. Discard the ginger flesh. Add the lime juice and zest, salt and freshly ground black pepper, garlic and chilli and leave to marinate for five minutes.
Heat a little vegetable oil in a griddle pan, add the marinated prawns and chargrill for 3-4 minutes, or until the prawns have turned pink and are completely cooked through. Transfer to a bowl, add the coconut and stir well. Add the spinach and stir.
For the caramelised onion, in a separate frying pan, heat one tablespoon of vegetable oil, add the onion and cook over a gentle heat for eight minutes, or until the onion has caramelised.
To serve, place the prawns on a serving plate, top with the caramelised onions and scatter with pine nuts. Garnish with the fresh coriander leaves.
