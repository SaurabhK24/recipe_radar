Ingredients:

For the panna cotta

3 gelatine leaves
250ml/9fl oz milk
250ml/9fl oz double cream
1 vanilla pod, split lengthways, seeds scraped out
25g/1oz sugar

For the sauce

175g/6oz sugar
175ml/6fl oz water
splash cherry liqueur
350g/12oz raspberries
To serve

4 sprigs fresh mint
icing sugar, to dust

Instructions:
For the panna cotta, soak the gelatine leaves in a little cold water until soft.
Place the milk, cream, vanilla pod and seeds and sugar into a pan and bring to a simmer. Remove the vanilla pod and discard.
Squeeze the water out of the gelatine leaves, then add to the pan and take off the heat. Stir until the gelatine has dissolved.
Divide the mixture among four ramekins and leave to cool. Place into the fridge for at least an hour, until set.
For the sauce, place the sugar, water and cherry liqueur into a pan and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the sugar has dissolved.
Take the pan off the heat and add half the raspberries. Using a hand blender, blend the sauce until smooth.
Pass the sauce through a sieve into a bowl and stir in the remaining fruit.
To serve, turn each panna cotta out onto a serving plate. Spoon over the sauce and garnish with a sprig of mint. Dust with icing sugar.
