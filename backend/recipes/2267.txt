Ingredients:

For the parmesan crisps

85g/3 oz parmesan cheese, grated

For the linguine

2 tomatoes, chopped
150ml/5 fl oz white wine
pinch chilli flakes
1 garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped
2 handfuls mussels, scrubbed, debearded (discard any that do not close tightly when tapped)
85g/3oz cooked and peeled prawns
3 tbsp chopped fresh flatleaf parsley
200g/7oz linguine, cooked according to packet instructions
3 tbsp parmesan cheese, grated

Instructions:
For the parmesan crisps, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Heat a baking sheet in the oven.
Pile small, flat circles of grated parmesan onto a silicone or similar non-stick sheet, leaving a space between them. Put the sheet on the hot baking sheet and cook in the oven for 1-2 minutes, or until the cheese melts. Remove the sheet from the tray and allow the crisps to cool and set.
Heat the tomatoes, wine, chilli and garlic in a frying pan until simmering.
Add the mussels to the pan, cover with a lid and cook gently for 3-4 minutes, or until the mussels have opened. Discard any that remain closed.
Stir in the prawns and parsley to warm them through, then add the cooked pasta.
Spoon the linguine and sauce onto a serving plate. Sprinkle the parmesan over the top and serve with the parmesan crisps.
