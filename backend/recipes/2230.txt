Ingredients:
12 fresh scallops, shelled and corals removed
3 tbsp olive oil
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 tsp finely chopped fresh parsley
squeeze lemon juice

Instructions:
Wash the scallops carefully and pat dry with a kitchen towel.
Place the scallops in a mixing bowl and mix with the olive oil, crushed garlic and chopped fresh parsley.
Chill the prepared scallops in the fridge for about half an hour.
When you are ready to cook the scallops, heat a large frying pan until it's extremely hot, and, just before cooking, lower the heat.
Place the prepared scallops in the hot pan and cook for a minute and a half on both sides.
Serve at once with a squeeze of lemon juice.
