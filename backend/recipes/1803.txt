Ingredients:
4 celery sticks, washed and cut in chunks
3 large carrots, peeled and cut in chunks
1 large white onion, chopped
10 tbsp Italian olive oil
4 bay leaves
4 fresh rosemary sticks
4 large pork chops
1 glass of red wine
4 cans Italian plum tomato (with the juice)
2 large courgettes, cut in chunks
4 tbsp double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
4 large potatoes, par-boiled

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 160C/320F/Gas 2.
In a large casserole dish, fry the celery, carrots and onion in six tablespoons of olive oil for about one minute.
Add in the bay leaves, two sticks of rosemary and the pork chops and continue to fry for a further minute.
Now add the wine and cook for two minutes, allowing the alcohol in the wine to evaporate.
Add the tinned tomatoes and courgettes along with the cream.
Season with salt and pepper and mix well.
Place a lid on top and bake in the oven for 90 minutes.
In the meantime, cut the potatoes into rounds 1cm/Â½in thick and shallow fry in the remaining olive oil with the remaining two rosemary sticks.
Once the potatoes are crisp, drain the excess oil and serve with the pork casserole.
