Title: Smoked salmon pâté
Prep time: Less than 30 mins
Cook time: No cooking required
Serves: 6
Author: Juliette Lawrence Wilson

Ingredients:
255g/9oz smoked salmon
110g/4oz cream cheese
2 tbsp double cream
½ lemon, juice only
2 tbsp chopped chives (plus some extra chives to sprinkle over the top)
pinch of sugar
salt and freshly ground pepper

Instructions:
Pop all the ingredients into a blender and pulse until it has a consistency that you desire. Plenty of pepper is good but go easy on the salt, as the smoked salmon will be salty already. Occasionally I would substitute lime and coriander instead of lemon and chives.
