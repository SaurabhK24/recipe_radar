Ingredients:

For the cabbage

½ head cabbage, shredded
3 tbsp white wine vinegar
3 tbsp Demerara sugar
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the venison

85g/3oz venison loin
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil

For the Stilton sauce

100ml/3½fl oz double cream
25g/1oz Stilton cheese, crumbled

Instructions:
For the cabbage, place all of the cabbage ingredients together in a pan and bring to a simmer. Cook for 12-15 minutes, or until the cabbage is very tender.
For the venison, season the meat with salt and freshly ground black pepper and rub over the oil.
Heat a frying pan until hot, then add the venison and cook for 4-5 minutes (for medium), turning to brown on all sides, or until cooked to your liking.
For the Stilton sauce, place the cream into a small pan and simmer for 4-5 minutes, or until reduced by about a third, then stir in the cheese until melted.
To serve, place the cabbage onto a serving plate. Thickly slice the venison and place on top of the cabbage, then spoon the cheese sauce around the edges of the plate.
