Ingredients:

For the salmon

55g/2oz pine nuts
25g/1oz butter
2 tbsp chopped fresh dill
25g/1oz white breadcrumbs
1 tbsp olive oil
100g/3½oz salmon fillet, skin on

For the roasted sweet potatoes

2 tbsp olive oil
½ sweet potato, peeled and sliced into 1cm/½ inch thick pieces
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the cherry tomato salsa

6 cherry tomatoes, halved
¼ onion, finely chopped
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
For the salmon, place the pine nuts, butter, dill and breadcrumbs into a food processor and blend until well combined.
Heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan until smoking and add the salmon, skin-side down. Fry for 2-3 minutes, or until the skin is golden-brown and crisp, then spread the pine nut mixture over the flesh side of the salmon. Transfer to the oven to cook for 5-6 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and the topping is golden-brown and crisp.
For the sweet potatoes, heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan. Fry the potato slices for one minute, coating in the oil. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, transfer to the oven and cook for 6-8 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are golden and tender.
For the salsa, combine all of the salsa ingredients together in a bowl and stir well.
To serve, pile the roasted sweet potatoes onto a serving plate and place the salmon on top. Spoon the salsa around the plate and serve.
