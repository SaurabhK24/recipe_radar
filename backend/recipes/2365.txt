Ingredients:
2 tbsp vegetable oil
4 lamb shanks
100g/3½oz plain flour, seasoned with salt and freshly ground black pepper
250ml/9fl oz red wine
1 onion, sliced
3 fresh sprigs rosemary
3 fresh bay leaves
300ml/½ pint chicken or vegetable stock
mashed potatoes, to serve

Instructions:
Heat the oil in a large frying pan.
Dredge the lamb shanks in the seasoned flour and fry in the frying pan for 4-5 minutes, turning regularly, or until browned all over. Place the lamb shanks in the slow cooker.
Deglaze the frying pan with the red wine and continue to cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the volume of the liquid has reduced by half. Pour the liquid into the slow cooker.
Add the onion, rosemary, bay leaves and stock to the slow cooker. The liquid should cover the meat - add more stock or boiling water if needed.
Cook on high for eight hours. Serve with mash.
