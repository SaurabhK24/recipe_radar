Ingredients:

For the peas 'bonne femme'

30g/1oz butter
½ onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
100g/3½oz frozen peas
2 tbsp white wine
2 tbsp double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the trout

55g/2oz almonds, chopped
handful fresh dill, chopped
30g/1oz butter, softened
1 trout fillet
sprig fresh dill, to serve

Instructions:
For the peas, heat the butter in a small saucepan over a medium heat and gently fry the onion until softened but not coloured. Add the garlic and cook for one minute.
Add the peas and white wine. Bring to the boil and simmer until the wine has reduced by half.
Add the double cream and simmer until slightly thickened. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and set aside to keep warm.
For the trout, place the almonds, dill and butter into a bowl and mix well.
Heat the almond and dill butter in a frying pan and fry the trout for 2-3 minutes on each side, turning with a fish slice, until golden-brown and completely cooked through.
To serve, place the peas onto a plate, top with the trout and pour over the butter left in the pan. Garnish with a sprig of dill.
