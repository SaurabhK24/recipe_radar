Serves: 4
Author: Paul Hollywood

Ingredients:
60g/2¼oz pudding rice
600ml/20fl oz full-fat milk
1 tbsp skimmed milk powder
2 tbsp caster sugar
1 thin strip lemon rind
freshly grated nutmeg, to taste
15g/½oz unsalted butter, cut into small cubes
jam, to serve

Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.
Wash the rice and drain in a sieve, then put it into a wide ovenproof dish, at least 1 litre/1¾pint capacity. Pour in the milk. Add the milk powder, caster sugar and lemon rind and stir together. Grate some nutmeg over the top and dot with the butter.
Place in the oven and bake for 2-2½ hours, or until the pudding has a golden-brown skin and the rice is tender and creamy (the longer you give it, the more thick and sticky it will become).
Serve warm, with a blob of your favourite jam on top.
