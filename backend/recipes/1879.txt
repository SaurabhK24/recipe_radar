Ingredients:

For the prawn curry

½ aubergine, finely chopped
1 tbsp vegetable oil
3 spring onions, sliced
¼ tsp turmeric
¼ tsp ground ginger
pinch of cayenne pepper
pinch of chilli flakes
½ tsp coriander seeds
½ tin cherry tomatoes
6 cooked prawns, shells off
4 tbsp Greek yoghurt

For the griddled aubergine

4 slices of aubergine, cut lengthways
2 tbsp olive oil

Instructions:
For the curry, fry the aubergine in a frying pan with the oil, spring onions and spices. Cook for 5 minutes.
Add the cherry tomatoes and prawns, then turn down the heat and cook for a further 5 minutes.
Finish by stirring in the Greek yoghurt and take off the heat.
For the griddled aubergine, rub the aubergine slices with oil on both sides and place on a hot griddle pan. Cook for 3 minutes on each side or until soft and charred.
Reserve one slice of the griddled aubergine and slice into four for decoration later.
With the 3 remaining slices, place a spoonful of the prawn mixture in the middle of each slice and roll to secure.
Place the parcels on a plate and decorate with the sliced aubergine.
