Ingredients:

For the fish

1 Maris Piper potato
2 x 180g/6oz boneless brill fillets, skin off
2g fennel pollen
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
knob of butter
1 lemon, juice only

For the sauce

1 banana shallot, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
250ml/9fl oz vegetable stock
250ml/9fl oz whipping cream
1 large handful flatleaf parsley, leaves only

For the tomatoes

3 mixed heritage tomatoes, sliced

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
For the fish, peel and top and tale the potato and put on a fruit and vegetable spiraliser set with a fine strand blade. Use according to manufacturer’s instructions, twisting the handle to create fine potato strands.
Season the fish fillets with fennel pollen and salt and pepper. Wrap the potato strands neatly around the fish portions.
Heat a non-stick pan to a medium heat, add a splash of oil and a knob of butter and fry the fish on both sides for around two minutes, or until golden-brown. Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Transfer the fish to the lined baking tray and cook in the preheated oven for a further six minutes.
For the sauce, heat a dash of oil in a saucepan and fry the shallot and garlic until softened. Add the stock and cook until the volume has reduced by half, add the cream and cook until reduced by half again.
Pour the sauce base into a blender or food processor and blend with parsley leaves on full power to achieve a vibrant green sauce.
For the tomatoes place the tomatoes on a baking tray, season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little extra virgin oil. Pop in the oven to warm through for a minute.
Remove the fish from the oven and squeeze over a little lemon juice. Arrange the tomato slices on each of two serving plates, place the fish on top and drizzle around the sauce.
