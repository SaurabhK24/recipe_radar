Ingredients:
30g/1¼oz breadcrumbs
30g/1¼oz parmesan cheese
handful fresh parsley, chopped
2 garlic cloves, crushed
150g/5¼oz salmon steak
150g/5¼oz broccoli, cut into florets

Instructions:
Place the breadcrumbs, cheese, parsley and garlic in a food processor and blend until combined. The mixture should form fine crumbs.
Coat the top of the salmon with the crumbs and bake in the oven for ten minutes or until the salmon is cooked through and the crumb is golden and crisp.
Meanwhile, boil a saucepan full of salted water and drop in the broccoli.
Cook the broccoli for four minutes or until just tender. Drain.
Serve on a plate topped with the salmon.
