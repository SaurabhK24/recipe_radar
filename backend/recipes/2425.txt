Ingredients:
85g/3oz sunblush tomatoes, chopped
½red chilli, deseeded, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, peeled, crushed
2 tbsp white wine
2 tbsp chopped fresh flatleaf parsley leaves
100g/3½oz fresh spaghetti, cooked according to packet instructions, drained
3 scallops, cleaned, coral removed
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Heat the sunblush tomatoes, chilli and garlic in a saucepan over a medium heat until simmering, stirring occasionally.
Add the wine and parsley to the pan, bring to a simmer, and cook for a further 3-4 minutes. Stir in the cooked spaghetti.
Rub the scallops all over with the oil, then season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.
Heat a griddle pan over a high heat. When the pan is hot, sear the scallops for one minute on each side, or until golden-brown griddle marks appear on each side of the scallops and the flesh of the scallops is opaque.
To serve, spoon the spaghetti arrabiata into the centre of a serving plate. Arrange the seared scallops on top.
