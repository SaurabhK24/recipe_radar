Author: Phil Vickery

Ingredients:

For the blackened steak

1 free-range egg white
1 tbsp black peppercorns, crushed
200g/7oz rump steak
1 tbsp olive oil
1 slice crusty white bread, toasted, to serve
100g/3½oz purple sprouting broccoli, steamed, to serve

For the red wine jus

75ml/2½fl oz red wine
1 tbsp red wine vinegar
30g/1oz butter
pinch salt

Instructions:
For the blackened steak, place the egg white into a bowl and the crushed peppercorns onto a plate. Dip the steak in the egg white, then press into the crushed peppercorns to coat the steak.
Heat the oil in a frying pan over a high heat and fry the steak for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking. Remove from the pan and set aside to keep warm.
For the red wine jus, add the red wine to the pan used to cook the steak, retaining the steak juices. Bring to a simmer, then add the red wine vinegar, butter and salt and cook for 1-2 minutes, until thickened slightly.
To serve, place the toast onto a serving plate, top with the steak and pour over the red wine jus. Serve with steamed purple sprouting broccoli.
