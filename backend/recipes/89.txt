Ingredients:
2 duck breasts
2 tsp honey
salt
pepper

Instructions:
Preheat a frying pan large enough to fry the duck breasts side by side.
Add the honey and allow to bubble gently.
Season both sides of the duck breast. Place into the frying pan skin-side down and cook gently until crisp.
Preheat the oven 180C/350F/Gas 4.
Place the duck breasts into a baking dish, skin side up. Bake for 8-10 minutes (longer if you want them well done).
Remove from the oven and leave to one side to rest for a few minutes before serving.
