Ingredients:

For the Sauce

1 tbsp tomato purée
¾ tsp salt
¼ tsp sugar
1 tsp garam masala
½ tsp ground roasted cumin seeds
¼ tsp chilli powder or to taste
3 tbsp finely chopped green coriander
1 fresh hot green chilli, finely chopped
1 tbsp lemon juice
200ml/7¼fl oz tinned coconut milk, well stirred, or single cream

For stir-frying the prawns

3 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tsp black mustard seeds
3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
10-15 curry leaves
560g/1lb 3¾oz medium-sized prawns, uncooked, peeled, deveined and washed then patted dry

Instructions:
Put the tomato purée in a bowl.
Add the salt, sugar, garam masala, ground roasted cumin seeds, chilli powder, green coriander, green chilli, lemon juice, and 1 tbsp water. Mix well.
Slowly add the coconut milk or cream, mixing as you go. Set aside.
Stir-fry the prawns: put the oil in a wok or frying pan and set over highish heat.
When hot, put in the mustard seeds. As soon as the mustard seeds begin to pop - this takes just a few seconds - put in the garlic and curry leaves.
Stir until the garlic turns medium brown and put in the prawns.
Stir until the prawns turn opaque most of the way through and put in the sauce.
Turn the heat to medium and just heat the sauce through until it begins to simmer. By then the prawns should be completely opaque and cooked through.
Turn off the heat.
