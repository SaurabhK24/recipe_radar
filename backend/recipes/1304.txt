Author: James Martin

Ingredients:
1 whole trout, scaled and gutted
½ bunch tarragon
1 lemon, sliced
150g/5½oz watercress leaves
3 tbsp chopped fresh flatleaf parsley
2 large spring onions, roughly chopped
1 garlic clove, roughly chopped
1 lemon, zest only
2 tbsp capers, rinsed and drained
2 tbsp dried breadcrumbs
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
salt and pepper

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
Stuff the cavity of the fish with the tarragon and lemon slices. Place in the oven for 20-30 minutes (depending on the size of the fish), or until cooked through.
Meanwhile, bring a small pan of salted water to the boil. Add the watercress leaves and cook for a minute. Drain and refresh the watercress in ice-cold water.
Transfer the watercress to a food processor, add the remaining ingredients and process to a purée. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To serve, place the whole trout on a large plate and peel back the skin. Pour over the salsa verde.
