Author: Raymond Blanc

Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil
400g/14oz Jersey Royal potatoes, quartered
1 onion, diced
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
2 bay leaves
1 thyme sprig
1 rosemary sprig
pinch Espelette pepper or smoked paprika
pinch sea salt
120g/4½oz cooking chorizo, cut into small dice
15g/½oz flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped
80g/3oz spinach, chopped
8 free-range eggs, beaten

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 170C/150C Fan/Gas 3½.
Heat the oil a medium sauté pan or frying pan with a lid over a medium heat. Gently fry the potatoes, onion, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, rosemary, Espelette pepper and salt for 13–15 minutes. Stir regularly to avoid any colouring.
Add the chorizo and fry for 5 minutes with the lid on so the flavours mingle. Add the parsley and spinach and stir for 30 seconds. Remove from the heat, add the eggs and stir until evenly mixed.
Pour the egg mixture into a 20cm/8in non-stick, ovenproof frying pan and place in the oven for 15 minutes, until cooked. Leave to rest for 5 minutes before turning out on to a board or a large serving dish.
Cut the omelette into 4–6 wedge-shaped slices using a serrated knife and serve warm.
