Author: Gino D'Acampo

Ingredients:
3 slices baguette, rubbed with olive oil
4 slices streaky bacon, grilled until crisp
1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra, to serve
¼ onion, finely chopped
75g/2½oz spinach
1 tsp chilli flakes
salt and freshly ground black pepper
100g/3½oz goats' cheese

Instructions:
Heat a griddle pan and griddle the baguette slices until golden-brown on both sides. Place one slice onto a serving plate and top with the bacon. Place the second baguette slice on top.
Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onion and gently fry until softened.
Add the spinach and chilli flakes and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, for 1-2 minutes, or until the spinach has wilted. Remove from the heat and drain off the excess water.
Place the spinach on top of the baguette on the serving plate. Top with the third slice of griddled baguette.
Heat a frying pan and fry the goats' cheese for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until just beginning to melt.
Place the goats' cheese on top of the tower and use a mini-blowtorch to brown all over.
To serve, drizzle with olive oil.
