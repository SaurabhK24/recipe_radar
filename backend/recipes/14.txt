Instructions:
For the sweet and sour monkfish, place the cornflour in a bowl, add the monkfish and season with salt and pepper.
Heat a wok and add one tablespoon of oil. Once hot, add the monkfish and cook until crisp on all sides. Remove and place on kitchen paper.
Place the pineapple chunks, juice, soy, lime juice and rice wine in a small food processor and blend until smooth.
Add the rest of the oil to the wok with the ginger and nearly all the chilli and spring onions and cook for 1-2 minutes.
Add the blended pineapple mixture to the wok and cook for two minutes.
Add the monkfish back into the pan and stir.
For the deep fried cabbage, heat a deep fat fryer to 160C/320F. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)
Remove the stems from the cabbage leaves and finely shred the leaves.
Fry the shredded cabbage in the deep fat fryer for a minute, remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Season with the sugar and salt.
To serve, place the sweet and sour monkfish in a shallow serving bowl and the deep fried cabbage on top. Shave the dried scallop roe on top of the cabbage with some spring onions and chilli.
