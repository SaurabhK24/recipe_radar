Author: Raymond Blanc

Ingredients:

For the pork belly

70g/2½oz acacia or Manuka honey
50g/1¾oz tomato ketchup
2 tbsp light soy sauce
4 tsp rice wine vinegar
10g root ginger, peeled and finely chopped
½ red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped
¼ shallot, finely chopped
75g/2½oz quince (about ¼ large quince), peeled and cut into 2cm/¾in wedges
500g/1lb 2oz pork belly, all bones removed, skin removed or scored

For the kale

20g/¾oz butter
pinch sea salt
280g/9¾oz Westland Winter or Red Curled kale leaves
8 Nero di Toscana kale leaves
To serve

150g/5½oz quince purée
1 tbsp sesame seeds, lightly toasted

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 120C/100C Fan/Gas ½.
For the pork belly, in a medium lidded casserole, mix all the ingredients except the pork. Add the belly and baste with the sauce. Bake for 3 hours, basting with the sauce every 20 minutes. When cooked, the pork will be firm but offer a little resistance when a knife is inserted. Lift the pork out of the casserole and set aside to rest, loosely covered with foil.
Strain the cooking juices into a saucepan over a high heat and bring to the boil. Reduce the volume of liquid by half so it thickly coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and reserve.
For the kale, in a large lidded saucepan, mix together 100ml/3½fl oz water, the butter and salt and bring to the boil. Add both varieties of kale and cook, covered with a lid, for 3–4 minutes, until barely cooked but still retaining a bit of bite and their wonderful colour. Drain well.
To serve, spread a spoonful of the quince purée in the centre of each plate. Add the kale, then slice the pork belly and divide between the plates. Finish with a little more purée and scatter over the sesame seeds.
