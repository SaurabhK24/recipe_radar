Serves: 4
Author: Simon Rimmer

Ingredients:

For the smoky potatoes

2 baking potatoes, cut into 2.5cm/1in cubes
4 tbsp olive oil
100g/3½oz unsalted butter
1 tbsp smoked paprika

For the pork chops

4 x 200g/7oz pork chops
2 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the creamy bacon cabbage

300g/10½oz smoked bacon lardons
1 head Savoy cabbage, shredded and blanched
125ml/4fl oz double cream

Instructions:
Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil and add the potatoes. Parboil for 4-5 minutes until just tender. Drain and set aside.
Meanwhile, snip vertical cuts in the pork chop fat at 2cm/1in intervals to stop the chops curling up when cooking. Rub the chops with the oil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Heat a griddle pan until hot and griddle the pork chops for about six minutes on each side, or until cooked through.
Meanwhile fry the bacon lardons in a frying pan until crisp. Add the shredded and blanched cabbage to heat through before adding the cream. Mix well to coat the cabbage and bacon with the cream.
For the smoky potatoes, heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the parboiled potatoes until crisp. Add the butter and paprika and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To serve, spoon the creamy cabbage onto four serving plates, top with a pork chop and serve the smoky potatoes alongside.
