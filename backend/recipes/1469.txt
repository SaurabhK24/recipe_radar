Ingredients:

For the Moroccan-spiced lamb

1 tsp coriander seeds
1 tsp cumin seeds
¼ tsp ground cinnamon
¼ tsp black peppercorns
100g/3½oz lamb leg steak
2 tbsp olive oil
3 tbsp honey
½ pomegranate, seeds only

For the couscous 'cake'

1 tbsp butter
85g/3oz couscous, cooked according to packet instructions
1 tbsp chopped fresh basil leaves
1 tbsp chopped fresh mint leaves
1 tbsp chopped fresh flatleaf parsley leaves

Instructions:
For the lamb, grind the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, cinnamon and black peppercorns in a mortar with a pestle. Rub the spice mixture over both sides of the lamb.
Heat a griddle pan until hot and drizzle the olive oil over the lamb. Cook the lamb for 4-5 minutes on both sides (for medium), or until golden-brown and cooked to your liking. Remove from the pan to rest on a warm plate.
Return the pan used to cook the lamb over a low heat and and stir in the honey and pomegranate seeds, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until the honey begins to bubble, then remove from the heat.
For the couscous 'cake', melt the butter in a small frying pan until foaming. Mix the cooked couscous with the basil, mint and flatleaf parsley. Pack the mixture into the pan and fry over a low heat for 5-7 minutes on each side (turn the 'cake' over carefully), or until golden-brown and crisp.
To serve, turn the couscous 'cake' out onto a plate. Thickly slice the lamb and arrange over the couscous. Drizzle the pomegranate and honey sauce around the edges of the plate.
