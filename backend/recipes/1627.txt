Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
For the sautéed potatoes, heat the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan and fry the potatoes, turning occasionally, until golden-brown and tender. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and keep warm.
For the roasted cherry tomatoes, place the cherry tomatoes on a baking sheet, drizzle with oil and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Roast in the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until they are just starting to collapse.
For the dressing, place the dressing ingredients into a small bowl and whisk together.
For the scallops, heat the oil in a small non-stick frying pan and fry the scallop discs for 30 seconds on each side, or until just cooked through.
To serve, place the potatoes onto a serving plate and top with the scallops and cherry tomatoes. Drizzle over the dressing.
