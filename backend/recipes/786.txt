Ingredients:

For the couscous

1 tbsp olive oil
200g/7oz couscous
400ml/14fl oz hot chicken stock
Â½ pomegranate, seeds only
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander, plus extra for serving
2 tbsp chopped fresh chervil, plus extra for serving

For the salmon

400g/14oz salmon fillet
1 lemon, cut into thin wedges
2 garlic cloves, sliced
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives
1 tbsp chopped fresh dill
splash fish or chicken stock

Instructions:
For the couscous, heat the olive oil in a pan. Pour in the couscous, and allow to roast and colour slightly in the pan for 3-4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and pour over the hot stock. Cover with cling film set aside for 5-6 minutes, or until the couscous has absorbed all of the liquid.
Fluff up the grains with a fork and stir in the pomegranate seeds and chopped fresh herbs.
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
For the fish, make three deep incisions in the fish and place a wedge of lemon and a slice of garlic into each. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and fry the salmon, skin-side down, for 2-3 minutes, or until the skin is golden-brown and crisp. Transfer the fish to an ovenproof dish, sprinkle with half the herbs and add a splash of stock. Place into the oven to roast for 8-10 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through.
To serve, spoon the couscous onto a serving plate and lay the fish fillet on top. Garnish with more fresh herbs.
