Ingredients:

For the spicy burger

½ tsp coriander seeds
½ tsp cumin seeds
pinch chilli flakes
pinch ground ginger
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
¼ onion, finely chopped
200g/7oz minced beef
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil

For the roast parsnips

1 parsnip, peeled and quartered
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
To make the burger, grind together the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, chilli flakes and ginger in a pestle and mortar.
Place the ground spices and chilli into a bowl and add the garlic, onion and minced beef. Mix together well, seasoning with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Shape the mince mixture into two patties.
Heat the olive oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the two patties and fry for two minutes on each side. Transfer the burgers to a baking sheet and place into the oven to bake for 8-10 minutes, or until completely cooked through.
For the roast parsnips, place the parsnips onto a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place into the oven and roast for 12-15 minutes, or until golden-brown.
To serve, place the two burgers on a large plate and serve the roast parsnips on the side.
