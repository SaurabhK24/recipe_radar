Ingredients:
5 sheets ready-made filo pastry
1 free-range egg, lightly beaten
1 apple, cored and thinly sliced
55g/2oz blue cheese, crumbled
1 tsp vegetable oil
85g/3oz piece back bacon, cut into strips, or bacon lardons

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
Lay a sheet of filo pastry onto a non-stick baking tray and brush with the beaten egg. Top with another sheet of filo and more beaten egg and repeat until you have used all the sheets of filo, finishing with a light brushing of beaten egg.
Use your fingers to crimp the edges of the filo pasrty to form a round shape with slightly raised edges.
Arrange the apple slices in the centre of the pastry and crumble over the cheese.
Transfer to the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes or until the pastry is crisp and golden.
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a small non-stick frying pan. Add the bacon pieces and fry until crisp.
To serve, transfer the tart to a serving plate and scatter over the crisp bacon.
