Ingredients:
2 x 225g/8oz pollock fillets, lightly salted
6 tbsp olive oil, plus 1 tbsp extra to fry
150g/5oz stale ciabatta bread, torn into pieces
4 tbsp red wine vinegar
4 ripe tomatoes, finely chopped
1 red onion, finely chopped
1 red pepper, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely sliced
1 bunch fresh basil, torn
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180C/365F/Gas 4.
Heat an ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat and add one tablespoon of olive oil.
Add the pollock fillets, flesh-side down and cook for 2-3 minutes, until golden-brown.
Turn the fillets over and transfer to the oven to roast for 5-6 minutes, or until just cooked through.
Meanwhile, soak the stale bread in the red wine vinegar in a bowl.
Add the tomatoes, red onion, red pepper and garlic and stir together gently.
Add the basil and the olive oil and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To serve, spoon equal portions of the panzanella salad onto each plate. Place a piece of pollock alongside and drizzle with some of the salad juices.
