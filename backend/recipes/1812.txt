Title: Beef and honey stew
Prep time: Less than 30 mins
Cook time: Over 2 hours
Serves: 4
Author: Polly Findlay

Ingredients:
30g/1oz plain flour
450g/1lb braising steak, cut into 2.5cm/1in cubes
3 tbsp vegetable oil
1 onion, roughly chopped
2 carrots, roughly chopped
2 leeks, roughly chopped
½ medium turnip, roughly chopped
1 tbsp honey
550ml/1 pint beef stock
2 large potatoes, cut into chunks
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Place the flour in a freezer bag then add the cubes of meat and shake well to coat.
Heat the oil in a large pan and brown the meat on all sides. (Do this in batches as adding too much meat at once makes the meat steam rather than brown.)
Fry the onion in the same pan you used for the meat, adding more oil if needed. Once the onion is browned, add the carrots, leeks, turnip, honey and beef stock and return the meat to the pan.
Cover the pan with a lid and simmer the stew over a very low heat for at least two hours – the longer it cooks, the better it will be.
About 20 minutes before serving, add the potato to the stew (adding them at this point means they keep their shape). Season, to taste, with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper before serving.
