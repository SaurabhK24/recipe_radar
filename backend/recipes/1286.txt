Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil
3 garlic cloves
2 springs rosemary, finely chopped
4 lamb chops

Instructions:
Preheat a barbecue to hot.
Combine the olive oil, garlic and rosemary in a small bowl. Stir well and brush the chops with the flavoured oil on both sides.
Cook for about three minutes on each side - the meat should still be slightly pink on the inside.
