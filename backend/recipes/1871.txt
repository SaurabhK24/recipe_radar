Cook time: 30 mins to 1 hour

Author: Simon Hopkinson

Ingredients:
25g/1oz butter
5 rashers fatty, smoked streaky bacon
1 large onion, chopped
500g/1lb 2oz floury potatoes, peeled, cut into small pieces
750ml/1â…“pt light chicken stock
salt and freshly ground white pepper
1 bay leaf
4-5 tbsp soured cream
1-2 tbsp snipped fresh chives

Instructions:
Melt the butter in a lidded saucepan and fry the bacon until golden-brown. Remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and set aside.
Fry the onion in the remaining fat until soft. Rinse the potatoes under cold running water until the water runs clear. Drain the potatoes. Pour the stock into the pan, and then add the potatoes, salt and freshly ground white pepper and bay leaf.
Bring up to a gentle simmer, skimming off any scum that forms on the surface, and add the bacon. Cover with a lid and simmer for 25-30 minutes, or until the potatoes begin to break up. Remove the bay leaf and bacon (you can crisp the bacon up for a sandwich if you like).
Pass the mixture through a vegetable mill using the finest mesh disk into a clean pan. You can also blend the soup in a food processor - though I find this method produce too smooth a result.
Gently reheat and ladle into hot bowls. Serve with a good dollop of soured cream and sprinkle with plenty of chives.
