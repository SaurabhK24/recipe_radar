Ingredients:

For the mayonnaise

4 free-range egg yolks
1 tsp white wine vinegar
250ml/9fl oz vegetable oil
1 tbsp tomato ketchup
squeeze lemon juice
dash Tabasco sauce
2 tbsp mixed chopped fresh herbs (basil, parsley, chives)
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the prawns

1 tbsp olive oil
10 raw prawns
½ avocado, stone removed
½ lemon, juice only

Instructions:
To make the mayonnaise, place the egg yolks and white wine vinegar into a mini-food processor and blend until combined.
With the food processor motor still running, gradually add the vegetable oil until the mixture thickens to a mayonnaise consistency.
Spoon half of the mayonnaise into a bowl and add the tomato ketchup, a squeeze of lemon juice, the Tabasco and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Mix together well.
Spoon the remaining mayonnaise into a separate bowl and mix with the chopped fresh herbs and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
For the prawns, heat the olive oil in a frying pan and add the prawns. Fry the prawns for 4-5 minutes, until they turn pink and are completely cooked through.
Scoop out the avocado flesh, leaving the skin intact and place the avocado flesh into a bowl.
Add the lemon juice, the cooked prawns and the spicy tomato mayonnaise. Stir well to combine.
To serve, spoon the prawn mixture into the avocado shell and top with a spoonful of the herb mayonnaise.
