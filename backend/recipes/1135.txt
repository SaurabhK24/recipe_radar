Ingredients:

For the sausages

1kg/2lb 2oz minced pork
1 tsp chopped red chilli
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
1 tsp fennel seeds
110ml/4fl oz red wine
4 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the sauce

2 large red peppers
2 large yellow peppers
1 tbsp salted capers, soaked for 30 minutes, then drained
1 garlic clove, sliced
½ red chilli, finely chopped
5 anchovies
olive oil

Instructions:
Mix the pork, chilli, garlic, fennel seeds, red wine, salt and freshly ground black pepper together in a bowl until well combined.
Using your hands, divide the mixture into 12 and roll each piece into a sausage shape roughly 8cm/3in long and 3cm/1¼in diameter.
For the sauce, heat a cast-iron griddle on the hob. Grill the peppers on all sides until the skins are black. Set aside to cool, peel away the skins and remove the seeds.
Blend the pepper with all the other ingredients (except the oil) in a food processor until smooth.
With the motor running, pour in enough oil until the dressing becomes a pouring consistency.
Heat one tablespoons of oil in a large non-stick pan, gently place the sausages into the pan and fry over a medium heat for 10 minutes, turning frequently, until golden-brown on all sides
Serve the sausages alongside the sauce.
