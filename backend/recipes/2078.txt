Ingredients:

For the roast sea bass

1 sea bass fillet, skin scored
olive oil, for drizzling
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the spring vegetables and sauce vierge

dash olive oil
½ onion, finely sliced
150g/5½oz sugar snap peas
½ lemon, juice only
200g/7oz basmati rice, cooked according to packet instructions (cooked weight)
salt and freshly ground black pepper
lemon wedges, to garnish

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
For the roast sea bass, drizzle the sea bass with olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat an ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat, add the sea bass skin-side down and fry for 2-3 minutes until golden-brown, then turn over and fry for a further 1-2 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for five minutes, until the fish is cooked through. Remove the fish from the pan and set aside.
For the spring vegetables and sauce vierge, heat the olive oil in the same pan and fry the onion until softened. Add the sugar snaps, lemon juice, cooked basmati rice, and cook until warmed through. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To serve, pile the rice onto a serving plate and top with the sea bass fillet. Garnish with lemon wedges.
