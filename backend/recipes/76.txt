Ingredients:
2 tsp Tabasco sauce (optional)
2 tbsp clear honey
2 tbsp sesame oil
2 tbsp soy sauce
4 chicken thighs, bone removed, sliced
1 tbsp vegetable oil
boiled rice, to serve
steamed bok choi, to serve

Instructions:
Put the Tabasco sauce (if using), honey, sesame oil and soy sauce in a bowl and mix well. Put the chicken slices into the bowl, stir well to coat and leave to marinate for 5 minutes.
Heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan. Remove the chicken slices from the marinade, reserving the marinade, and fry for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until completely cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside, keep warm.
Pour the marinade into the pan and boil rapidly for a few minutes until slightly reduced.
To serve, put the chicken slices on a plate and pour over the sauce. Serve with rice and steamed bok choi.
