Ingredients:
150g/5Â½oz pork chop, bone removed
large handful fresh rocket
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 slice prosciutto
1 tbsp olive oil

Instructions:
Place the pork chop onto a chopping board, cover with cling film and flatten with a rolling pin or meat mallet.
Remove the cling film. Place half of the rocket on top of the pork and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Roll the pork up to enclose the rocket, wrap the prosciutto around the pork and secure with cocktail sticks.
Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the pork and fry, turning occasionally, until golden-brown and completely cooked through.
Remove the pork from the pan and serve on a pile of the remaining rocket.
