Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 210C/425F/Gas 7 or use a very hot pizza oven.
Place the shallot, anchovies, mustard and all the chopped herbs into a food processor with a pinch of salt and pepper and blend to a fine pur√©e. Add the olive oil and blend once more.
Add the capers and the juice of half a lemon. Pulse for a few seconds until still slightly chunky.

Put a couple of spoonfuls of the salsa verde into the cavity of the trout along with the reserved herb stalks. Drizzle with olive oil and season well with salt and black pepper.
Place in the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, or until just cooked through.
Serve the trout with the roasted new potatoes, lemon and a drizzle of the remaining salsa verde.
