Ingredients:

For the crisp salmon

1 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp butter
85g/3oz salmon fillet, skin on
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the turmeric rice

85g/3oz basmati rice
½ tsp ground turmeric

For the warm tomato dressing

100ml/3½fl oz fish stock
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp tomato purée
To serve

1 small handful pine nuts, toasted

Instructions:
For the salmon, heat the olive oil and butter in a pan and season the fish with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Lay the fish skin-side down into the pan and fry for 4-5 minutes, then flip over and cook for a further 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown all over and cooked to your liking. Set aside on a warm plate.
For the turmeric rice, cook the rice according to packet instructions. During the last two minutes of cooking, stir in the turmeric. When cooked, fluff up the grains with a fork.
For the warm tomato dressing, heat the fish stock, olive oil and tomato purée together in a saucepan and whisk to combine. Bring to a gentle simmer and reduce for 4-5 minutes.
To serve, spoon the rice onto a plate and place the salmon on top. Drizzle the warm dressing around the edges of the plate and scatter the pine nuts over the top.
