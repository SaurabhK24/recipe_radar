Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil
Â½ leek, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, chopped
2 tbsp double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 slices ciabatta, drizzled with olive oil
2 rashers streaky bacon
2 free-range eggs
55g/2oz broccoli, cut into florets and cooked until tender

Instructions:
Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the leek and garlic and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until softened.
Add the cream and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper and simmer for one minute.
Heat a griddle pan until smoking. Add the ciabatta and griddle for two minutes each side, or until nicely toasted.
Add the bacon to the griddle pan and cook for two minutes on each side, or until golden-brown and cooked through.
Crack two eggs into a pan of simmering water. Poach the eggs for 3-4 minutes, or until cooked to your liking, then scoop out with a slotted spoon and set aside.
To serve, place the chargrilled ciabatta onto a plate, top with leek mixture, then place the poached eggs on top. Garnish with the bacon and cooked broccoli.
