For the sea bass

For the potatoes

15g/½oz butter
55g/2oz new potatoes, sliced 2cm thick, parboiled
handful spinach

For the shallots

15g/½oz butter
2 shallots, peeled and halved through root
1 tbsp caster sugar
2 tbsp red wine

For the sauce

55g/2oz pancetta
150ml/6fl oz red wine
1 tbsp caster sugar

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.
For the sea bass, heat an oven-proof griddle pan until smoking, then place the fish, skin side- down, onto the pan and cook for two minutes. Transfer to the oven and roast for 5-10 minutes, or until cooked through.
For the potatoes, melt the butter in a large frying pan, and when melted add the potatoes and sauté until golden. Add the spinach to the potatoes and cook until the spinach is wilted.
To make the shallots, melt the butter in a small pan and once foaming, add the shallots, sugar and wine. Place into the oven for 10 minutes.
For the sauce, place the pancetta into a frying pan and fry for 3-4 minutes, add the red wine and sugar to the pan and simmer for 4-5 minutes, to reduce and thicken.
To serve, place the potatoes and shallots onto a warmed plate, top with the fish and pour the sauce over.
