Ingredients:
1 medium to large pork fillet
200g/7Â¼oz good quality black pudding
1 golden delicious apple, peeled, thinly sliced and blanched
salt and freshly ground black pepper
knob of butter
a little olive oil

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400C/Gas 6.
Cut the pork open with a sharp knife and open the fillet out along its length, being careful not to cut all the way through the fillet.
Cut the black pudding into a sausage shape and place along the length of the fillet. Scatter the apple alongside the black pudding. Season well.
Gently roll up the fillet and tie with string.
Wrap the fillet in cling film and allow to rest in the fridge for a couple of hours before cooking.
To cook, season the fillet and panfry with a little butter and olive oil and place in the oven for fifteen minutes.
Allow to rest before serving so that the meat soaks up the juices.
