Ingredients:
100g/3Â½oz chicken breast, cut into strips
2 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp honey
1 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted
1 small handful fresh parsley leaves

Instructions:
Soak two wooden skewers in a bowl of cold water for ten minutes.
Thread the chicken onto the skewers and drizzle over half of the olive oil.
Heat a griddle pan until smoking and cook the chicken skewers for 4-5 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown and cooked through. Drizzle over the honey and sprinkle over the sesame seeds.
To serve, place the chicken skewers onto a serving plate. Toss the parsley leaves with the remaining olive oil and drizzle on the plate next to the chicken skewers.
