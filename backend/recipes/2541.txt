Ingredients:

For the cracked black pepper squid

1 baby squid, cleaned
salt and freshly ground black pepper
dash olive oil
squeeze lemon juice

For the chilli squid

1 baby squid, cleaned
salt and freshly ground black pepper
pinch dried chilli flakes
1 tbsp olive oil
squeeze lemon juice
To serve

lemon wedges, to garnish

Instructions:
For the black pepper squid, cut the tentacles off the squid and reserve for the chilli squid. Remove the 'ears' from either side of the squid body and pull away the skin with your fingers. Cut open the body and score the inside of the squid with the tip of a sharp knife to make a diamond pattern.
Season the squid with salt and freshly ground black pepper and brush with olive oil. Heat a griddle pan until very hot, then add the squid and chargrill for one minute on each side, or until the squid is just cooked.
For the chilli squid, cut the tentacles off the squid, just below the eyes, being sure not to cut the ink sac. Be sure to remove the 'beak' at the base of the tentacles. Repeat with the reserved tentacles. Remove the 'ears' from either side of the squid body and pull away the skin with your fingers, then slice the body into rings.
Season the squid rings and tentacles with the chilli flakes, salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan until smoking, then add the squid rings and tentacles and fry for 1-2 minutes, or until the squid is just cooked.
To serve, pile both the black pepper and chilli squid onto a serving plate and garnish with the lemon wedges.
