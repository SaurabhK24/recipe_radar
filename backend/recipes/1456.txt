Ingredients:
2 slices white bread
1kg/2lb 4oz beef mince
1 large red onion, chopped
3 tbsp tomato ketchup
1 free-range egg
2 tbsp brown sauce
1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
70g/2½oz parmesan cheese, grated
1 tbsp chopped fresh oregano
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
1 tbsp milk
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
Place the bread in a food processor and pulse to make breadcrumbs.
Mix the breadcrumbs with the remaining ingredients in a large bowl until the mixture pulls away from the sides of the bowl and forms a ball.
Form the mixture into a loaf shape and place in an ovenproof dish or loaf tin. Bake in the oven for 50–60 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.
