Ingredients:

For the lamb chop

1 lamb chop
dash olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the curried parsnip batons

1 parsnip, peeled, cut into batons
25g/1oz butter
pinch curry powder
85ml/3fl oz double cream
splash white wine
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the parsnip crisps

4 tbsp vegetable oil
1 small parsnip, finely sliced into rounds on a mandoline
salt, for sprinkling

For the thyme oil

4 tbsp olive oil
2 sprigs fresh thyme

Instructions:
For the grilled lamb chop, heat a griddle pan until hot. Brush the lamb with olive oil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place the lamb into the hot griddle pan and griddle for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown but slightly pink in the middle. Remove from the pan and leave to rest for five minutes, covered with aluminium foil.
For the curried parsnip batons, place the parsnip batons into a pan of boiling salted water and blanch for 2-3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and dry on kitchen paper.
Melt the butter in a frying pan, add the blanched parsnips and curry powder and stir to coat in the melted butter. Gently fry for 2-3 minutes.
Add the cream and wine, season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and simmer until the sauce is thickened and the parsnips are tender.
For the parsnip crisps, heat the oil in a pan, add the parsnip slices and fry until golden-brown and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Sprinkle with salt.
For the thyme oil, place the oil and thyme into a small saucepan and heat gently for ten minutes. Remove from the heat and leave to infuse. Just before serving, remove the thyme.
To serve, spoon the curried parsnips onto a serving plate and top with the grilled lamb. Drizzle over the thyme oil and garnish with the parsnip crisps.
