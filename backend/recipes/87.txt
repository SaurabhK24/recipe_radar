Ingredients:
675g/1Â½lb floury potatoes, peeled and cut into 2.5cm (1in) cubes
6 rashers smoked, streaky bacon, cooked until crisp
2 large dill cucumbers, diced
2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped
4 spring onions, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the dressing

1 tbsp lemon juice
1 tbsp chopped dill
1 tbsp snipped chives
1 tbsp mayonnaise
3 tbsp soured cream

Instructions:
Cook the potatoes in salted water until soft, then drain and return to the heat to dry out. It is important that the potatoes are thoroughly cooked.
Combine the potatoes with the crumbled crispy bacon, the diced cucumber, eggs and spring onions. Season.
Combine the remaining ingredients to make the dressing.
Fold enough of the dressing into the salad to make it creamy.
Try to fold everything together while the potatoes are still warm, and allow the potatoes to break down a little in the mixing.
Serve.
