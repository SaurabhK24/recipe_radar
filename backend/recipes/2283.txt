Ingredients:

For the seared salmon

150g/5oz salmon fillet
salt and freshly ground black pepper
25g/1oz butter
squeeze lemon juice

For the sweet-and-sour tomatoes

85g/3oz cherry tomatoes, halved
1 tsp caster sugar
dash red wine vinegar
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the wilted watercress

dash olive oil
large handful fresh watercress
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
For the seared salmon, season the salmon fillet on both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Melt the butter in a frying pan until frothing, then add the salmon skin-side down and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown. Turn the fish over, squeeze over the lemon juice, remove from the heat and allow the salmon to finish cooking in the residual heat.
For the sweet-and-sour tomatoes, place the tomatoes, sugar and red wine vinegar into a saucepan and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Gently simmer over a medium heat for ten minutes, or until the tomatoes have softened.
For the wilted watercress, heat a dash of olive oil in a pan, add the watercress and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently, until the watercress has wilted.
To serve, pile the wilted watercress onto a serving plate, top with the salmon fillet and spoon the sweet-and-sour tomatoes on the side.
