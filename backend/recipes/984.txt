Author: James Martin

Ingredients:

For the fish stock

250g/9oz white fish trimmings, rinsed
2 leeks, white part only, roughly chopped
½ bulb fennel, roughly chopped
2 carrots, roughly chopped
1 bay leaf

For the flambéed lobster

1 tbsp olive oil
2 shallots, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
2 canned plum tomatoes, drained and finely chopped
2 cooked lobsters, split, tail and claw meat removed, cut into serving pieces
75ml/3fl oz brandy
110ml/4fl oz fish stock
50g/2oz butter
3 tbsp chervil, roughly chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
For the fish stock, place all the fish stock ingredients into a saucepan and cover with cold water. Place on the heat and bring to the boil.
Reduce the heat and simmer for 25 minutes, skimming off any scum that sits on the surface. Strain into a container and use when needed (the stock can be frozen if necessary - make sure it has cooled completely before you place it in the freezer and that the container you use is suitable for freezing).
For the flambéed lobster, heat a sauté pan until hot, add the olive oil, shallots and garlic and cook for two minutes.
Add the tomatoes and sauté for one minute. Stir in the lobster and the brandy.
Tip the pan towards the heat so that the brandy is set alight, tossing the lobster to be covered by the flames. Once the flames have subsided, add the fish stock and simmer for two minutes. Stir in the butter and chervil, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and serve at once.
