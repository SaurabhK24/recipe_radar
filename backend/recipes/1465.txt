Ingredients:

For the flatbread

200g/7¼oz plain flour
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
½ tsp ground cinnamon
water, to bind
pinch of salt

For the filling

1 clove garlic, finely chopped
2 tsp ground cumin
2 tsp thyme, chopped
75ml/2½fl oz olive oil
1 lamb leg steak
1 pepper, roasted and skinned
1 aubergine, sliced and grilled
1 courgette, sliced and grilled
50g/1¾oz sun-dried tomatoes
100g herby marinated olives, stoned
1 lemon, juice only
100g/3½oz rocket

For the harissa

4 large red chillies
6 cloves garlic
25g/1oz fresh coriander
1 lemon, juice and zest only
olive oil

Instructions:
To make the flatbread, mix the dry ingredients together and add water until a firm dough has formed.
Divide the dough into six and roll out the flatbreads thinly.
Cook in a very hot, dry, non-stick pan for one minute on each side or until brown spots appear on both sides.
Now make the filling. Place the garlic, cumin, thyme, and a tablespoon of the olive oil in a bowl and coat the lamb steak well. Leave this to marinate for one hour.
Next, place the lamb steak on a hot griddle and cook for a few minutes either side. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly, then slice thinly.
Slice up the roasted vegetables and sun-dried tomatoes, toss in another bowl with the olives and pour the remaining olive oil and the lemon juice over them.
Now make the harissa. With a hand blender, whiz up the chillies, garlic and coriander with the lemon juice and enough olive oil to make a mayonnaise consistency. Season to taste.
Lay two flatbreads on a plate and add a couple of spoons of the roasted vegetables to each. Add the sliced lamb, then some rocket, and then a spoon of harissa dressing. Repeat with the remaining flatbreads.
Roll up the flatbreads and cut in half. Serve the halves around a pile of rocket drizzled with the harissa dressing.
