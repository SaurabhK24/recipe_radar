Ingredients:

For the roasted crispy duck

1 duck breast, skin scored
½ tsp salt

For the spicy noodles

½ red pepper
½ tsp mild curry powder
½ tsp coriander
pinch chilli powder
2 garlic cloves
2 tbsp vegetable oil
200g/7oz egg noodles, cooked according to packet instructions, drained
1 tbsp sesame oil

For the sweet-and-sour plum chutney

1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tbsp sesame oil
1 garlic clove, peeled, crushed
2 plums, stones removed, chopped
pinch chilli powder
1 tbsp brown sugar
½ tsp salt
1 tbsp soy sauce
To serve

lime wedges
1 tsp sesame seeds

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
For the duck, rub the salt into the duck skin and place skin-side down in a hot pan for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown. Turn over and cook for a further 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown all over, then transfer to the oven to cook through for 4-5 minutes. Remove and allow to rest.
For the noodles, place all the ingredients except the noodles and sesame oil in a small food processor and pulse to a smooth paste. Mix in with the cooked, drained egg noodles and sesame oil until the noodles are evenly coated.
For the plum chutney, heat the oils together in a pan and fry the garlic, plums and chilli powder for 3-4 minutes, or until softened, then add the remaining ingredients. Cook for 7-8 minutes, or until the plums break down and the mixture is thick and sticky.
Serve the duck breast sliced on top of a bed of the noodles and the chutney spooned around the outside. Garnish with lime wedges and sesame seeds.
