Ingredients:

For the toad in the hole

1 tbsp olive oil
3 fresh sage leaves
1 red onion, peeled, finely sliced
3 sausages
3 free-range eggs
150ml/5fl oz whole milk
150g/5oz self-raising flour
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the cheese sauce

150ml/5fl oz double cream
150g/5oz cheddar cheese, grated
salt and freshly ground black pepper
fresh parsley, to garnish

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
For the toad in the hole, place the oil and sage leaves into an ovenproof fryingpan and heat.
Add the sliced red onion and the sausages and fry, turning occasionally, until golden-brown all over, then remove from the heat and set aside.
Whisk the eggs, milk and flour together in a bowl to create a smooth batter and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Return the pan of sausages, onions and sage to the heat and once hot, pour the batter into the pan. Transfer to the oven to bake for 10-12 minutes, until the batter is risen and golden and the sausages completely cooked through.
For the sauce, heat the cream in a pan. Add the cheese and stir to melt into the cream. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To serve, spoon the toad in the hole onto a warm plate. Pour over the cheese sauce and sprinkle with chopped parsley to garnish.
