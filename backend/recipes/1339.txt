Ingredients:
1 very fresh lemon sole fillet, skin removed, cut into thin strips
1 lime, juice and zest
1 lemon, juice only
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp finely chopped fresh coriander
1 tbsp olive oil
orange and lime wedges, to serve

Instructions:
Lay the sole strips on a serving plate and drizzle over the lime and lemon juice. Scatter over the lime zest and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside for about ten minutes so that the sole begins to 'cook' in the citrus juice.
Sprinkle over the coriander and olive oil. Garnish with orange and lime wedges and serve.
