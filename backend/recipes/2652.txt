Prep time: Less than 30 mins
Cook time: 10 to 30 mins

Author: Brian Turner

Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil
2 chicken thighs
salt and freshly ground black pepper
Â½ onion, chopped
55g/2oz sun-dried tomatoes in oil, drained
2 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp white wine vinegar
1 tbsp clear honey
small handful fresh parsley, chopped
2 sprigs fresh rosemary, to garnish

Instructions:
Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the chicken thighs and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fry over a low-medium heat until golden-brown on all sides.
Add the onion and fry until softened. Add the sun-dried tomatoes, soy sauce, white wine vinegar and honey and simmer for 2-3 minutes, or until the chicken is completely cooked through - you can test this by piercing the thickest part with a skewer and checking that the juices run clear.
Stir in the chopped parsley and then spoon onto a serving plate. Garnish with rosemary sprigs and serve.
