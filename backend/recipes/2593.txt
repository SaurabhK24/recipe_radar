Heat half of the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the mince and cook until brown. Tip the mince into a sieve and drain off any excess fat.
Wipe the pan clean, add the remaining oil and fry the onions and garlic until softened. Return the mince to the pan.
Add the curry powder, lemon juice and zest, mango chutney, sultanas, toasted almonds and soaked bread and stir well.
Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then transfer everything into a greased soufflé dish or loaf tin.
Stick the bay leaves into the mixture.
Break the eggs into a bowl and whisk together with the milk. Pour the egg mixture over the meat mixture.
Cover with tin foil and place into the oven to bake for 40 minutes, or until cooked through and the golden brown.
Serve with rice, chutneys of your choice, yoghurt and any other curry-style accompaniments that take your fancy.
