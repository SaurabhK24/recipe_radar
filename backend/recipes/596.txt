Ingredients:
2 chicken breasts
50g fresh white breadcrumbs
200ml whole milk
2-3 tbsp olive oil or vegetable oil
1 large onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 large mild green chilli, seeds removed, finely chopped
1 tsp paprika
Â¼ tsp turmeric
salt and freshly ground black pepper
35g ground walnuts
20g grated parmesan

Instructions:
Place the chicken in a saucepan, add just enough boiling water to cover, then bring to the boil and simmer for 8-10 minutes, or until opaque and cooked through. Remove from the water and set aside on a plate to cool, reserve the cooking liquor. When cool enough to handle, shred the chicken.
Meanwhile, soak the breadcrumbs in the milk.
Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat and fry the onion for 7-8 minutes, or until softened and golden. Add the garlic and chilli and fry for a further minute until fragrant. Stir in the paprika, turmeric and seasoning and fry for a minute, adding a little more oil if the mixture looks dry.
Add the shredded chicken and stir to coat in the spices for a minute, then pour in the soaked breadcrumbs and milk. Add 200ml of the reserved stock, bring to a boil then lower the heat and simmer gently for five minutes. Stir in the nuts and simmer for a further 5 minutes, or until the sauce is rich and creamy, adding a little more stock if it gets too thick.
Stir in the parmesan, season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
