Ingredients:
½ tsp sesame oil
25g/1oz cornflour
1 free-range egg white, lightly whisked
125g/4½oz pork tenderloin cut into three pieces
1 tsp finely chopped fresh parsley,
1 tsp finely chopped fresh sage
1 tsp finely chopped spring onion
25g/1oz blue cheese
55g/2oz breadcrumbs
1 tbsp olive oil

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.
Place the cornflour, egg and sesame oil into a bowl and whisk together to create a thick batter.
Using a sharp knife, make an incision into all three of the pieces of pork to create a pocket in each and set aside.
In a bowl mix together the herbs, spring onion and cheese. Stuff a little of this cheese mixture into the pocket in each of the pork slices.
Dip the stuffed pork pieces into the batter mixture and then dip into a bowl of the breadcrumbs to coat thoroughly.
Heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan and when hot add the breadcrumbed pork pieces and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden brown all over.
Transfer the pork into the oven and cook for 7-10 minutes or until completely cooked through.
