Author: Paul Rankin

Ingredients:
250ml/10fl oz vegetable oil, for deep frying
1 tsp sesame oil
25g/1oz cornflour
1 free-range egg white, lightly whisked
125g/4½oz pork tenderloin, cut into bite-sized slices
1 tbsp olive oil
½ red pepper, sliced
2 spring onions, sliced
½ tsp dried chilli flakes
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp honey
55g/2oz basmati rice, cooked according to packet instructions
fresh dill, chopped to garnish

Instructions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a deep, heavy bottomed saucepan, until very hot or until a breadcrumb sizzles in it (CAUTION: Hot oil is very dangerous. Do not leave unattended).
Make a batter by whisking the sesame oil, cornflour and egg white together. Dip the pork in the batter to coat, then place into the hot oil to deep fry for three minutes or until crisp and cooked through. Remove and drain on kitchen towels.
Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a wok. Add the pepper, onions and chilli flakes and stir-fry for three minutes. Then add the soy sauce, honey and pork, and cook for one minute to warm through.
Serve with the cooked rice and garnish with dill.
