Instructions:
For the salad, cook the cauliflower and broccoli in boiling salted water for 4-5 minutes, then drain.
Heat the oil in a frying pan and lightly fry the onion for 3-4 minutes, then add the cauliflower and broccoli, chilli flakes and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Continue to cook for 5-6 minutes, stirring frequently, until the broccoli and cauliflower turn crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.

Pile the broccoli and cauliflower onto a serving plate, top with the halved sausage, and spoon the chilli tomato chutney around the plate. Garnish with the chopped fresh chives and serve.
