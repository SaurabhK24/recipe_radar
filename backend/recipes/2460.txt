1 free-range egg, beaten
150g/5½oz fresh brown and white crabmeat
1 tbsp plain flour, plus extra for dusting
salt and freshly ground black pepper
pinch chilli flakes
2 tbsp vegetable oil

For the sesame Asian relish

3 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted in a hot pan
2 tbsp soy sauce
2 tsp sesame oil
¼ Romero pepper, deseeded, roasted, finely chopped
1 lime, juice only
small handful fresh coriander leaves, chopped
To serve

Instructions:
For the crabcakes, mix the breadcrumbs, egg, crabmeat, flour, salt and freshly ground black pepper and chilli flakes in a bowl.
Shape the crab mixture into four patties and dust with a little more flour.
Heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the crab patties and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown on all sides. Remove from the pan, drain on kitchen paper and keep warm.
For the relish, place the sesame seeds, soy sauce, sesame oil, roasted Romero pepper and lime juice into a small pan over a medium heat and heat through.
Add the chopped coriander, then spoon the mixture into a small dipping bowl.
To serve, place the crabcakes onto a plate and serve with the lime wedges and the bowl of dipping sauce alongside.
