Ingredients:

For the cake

3 free-range eggs
75g/2¾oz golden caster sugar
75g/2¾oz self-raising flour
butter, for greasing

For the filling

5 tbsp raspberry jam
125ml/4½fl oz double cream, whipped
100g/3½oz pink marshmallows
100g/3½oz raspberries
icing sugar, to dust

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
For the cake, crack the eggs into a bowl, add the sugar and beat together until pale and fluffy. Fold in the flour.
Grease and line a 23 x 30cm/9 x 12in swiss roll tin. Pour the cake mixture into the tin and smooth the top with a wet spatula.
Transfer to the oven and bake for 7-10 minutes, or until golden-brown and springy to the touch. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly, then turn out onto a sheet of baking paper.
For the filling, spread the jam over the cake, followed by the cream.
Place the marshmallows into a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on full for about 15 seconds, or until beginning to soften. Spoon the marshmallows on top of the cream.
Spread the raspberries along the edges of the cake, then roll the cake up in a cigar shape. Dust with icing sugar.
