Ingredients:
4 fresh chorizo sausages, hot or mild, thickly sliced on the diagonal
750g/1½lb canned white beans (cannellini, white kidney, alubias), drained and rinsed
1 tbsp olive oil
100ml/3½fl oz chicken stock or water
1 tsp smoked paprika
140g/5oz plain flour
1 tsp salt
½ tsp pepper
450g/1lb fresh squid (calamari), cleaned
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
110g/4oz rocket leaves
1 lemon, quartered

Instructions:
Fry the chorizo slices in olive oil in a frying pan until they crisp a little on the edges. Add the beans, chicken stock and paprika and simmer gently for 5 minutes.
Mix the flour, salt, pepper and paprika together. Put a colander over a basin. Cut the squid bodies into 1cm/½in rings and the tentacles into small sections.
Toss the squid pieces in the flour, then tip them into the colander and vigorously shake off the excess flour into the bowl below.
Heat 3 tbsp light olive oil in a frying pan until hot and fry the squid very quickly, turning once, then drain on a paper towel. Do this in batches rather than crowding the pan.
Divide the beans and sausage between four warmed dinner plates, scatter with rocket leaves (if using) and arrange the fried squid on top. Serve with lemon wedges.
