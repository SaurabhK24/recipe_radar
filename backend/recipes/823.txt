Ingredients:

For the crisp beef and noodle rolls

3 tbsp vegetable oil
100g/3½oz sirloin steak, cut into strips
freshly ground black pepper
100g/3½oz rice noodles, cooked according to packet instructions, drained

For the soy and honey sauce

1 tbsp sesame oil
2 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp runny honey
1 lime, juice only
To serve

85g/3oz broccoli, steamed

Instructions:
For the crisp beef and noodle roll, heat one tablespoon of the oil in a frying pan over a high heat. Add the beef strips, season with freshly ground black pepper and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until browned and cooked to your taste. Remove from the pan.
Wrap the beef strips in the cooked rice noodles.
Heat the remaining oil in the same frying pan over a medium heat. Fry the noodle parcels for 3-4 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown. Remove from the pan and drain on kitchen paper.
For the soy and honey sauce, heat the sesame oil, soy sauce, honey and lime juice in a small saucepan over a medium heat and cook for 3-4 minutes until the liquid has reduced slightly.
To serve, place the crispy beef and noodle rolls and the steamed broccoli onto a serving plate. Pour the soy and honey sauce into a dipping bowl and serve on the side.
