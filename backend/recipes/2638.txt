Ingredients:

For the vegetable consommé

12 ripe tomatoes, chopped
¼ cucumber, chopped
splash Worcestershire sauce
splash red wine vinegar
salt
2 garlic cloves
handful basil leaves

For the tapenade

1 garlic clove
4 tbsp capers
200g/7oz black olives
splash sherry vinegar
extra virgin olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the salad

5 tomatoes, preferably mixed colours
3 asparagus spears, tips only
5 radishes
½ bulb fennel
100g/3½oz broad beans
small bunch baby basil

Instructions:
For the vegetable consommé, season the tomatoes and cucumbers and with Worcestershire sauce and red wine vinegar.
Blend all the ingredients together in a food processor.
Place a sieve lined with a muslin cloth on top of a bowl, then pour in the vegetable consommé mixture.
Bring the edges of the muslin together, tie with a piece of string and hang over the bowl. Leave for six hours to drain. Reserve the liquid consommé collected in the bowl.
For the tapenade, blend all of the ingredients in a food processor, adding just enough olive oil until it forms a paste, seasoning to taste with salt and pepper.
For the salad, slice the tomatoes into different sized pieces.
Slice the asparagus, radish and fennel and place them in a bowl of cold, iced water to chill. When ready to serve, drain.
To serve, divide the tomatoes, broad beans and chilled vegetables between four small serving bowls and garnish with the tapenade and baby basil. Pour over the consommé.
