Ingredients:

For the waffles

260g/9½oz plain flour
1 tbsp baking powder
1 tsp sea salt flakes
1 tbsp granulated sugar
3 large free-range eggs, lightly beaten
425ml/15fl oz full-fat milk
110g/3¾oz unsalted butter, melted
150g/5½oz leftover smoked salmon, torn into small pieces
2 tbsp finely chopped chives

For the pancetta, maple syrup and ice cream

12 thin slices pancetta
maple syrup, to taste
vanilla ice cream, to taste

Instructions:
Preheat the waffle maker and preheat the oven to 140C/120C Fan/Gas 1. Put a large wire rack on a baking tray and keep it warm in the oven.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Whisk in the eggs, milk and butter and combine thoroughly. Mix in the smoked salmon and chives.
Ladle the batter into each well of the waffle maker and close the lid. Cook the waffles for 5 minutes, then lift the lid and check the waffle – it should be golden-brown and crisp. Transfer to the wire rack in the oven and repeat the process with the remaining batter.
For the pancetta, preheat the grill to high. Place the pancetta on a lined tray and grill for 6-7 minutes until crisp, turning once.
Serve the waffles with the pancetta, maple syrup and ice cream.
