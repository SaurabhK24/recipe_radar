Ingredients:
½ very fresh sea bass fillet
1 lime, juice and zest
1 tsp vegetable oil
1 tsp sesame seeds
½ tsp sesame oil
1 tsp soy sauce
To serve

½ lime
2 vine tomatoes, cut into wedges
sprig fresh dill
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives

Instructions:
Slice the sea bass fillet thinly using a very sharp knife.
Arrange the sea bass slices on a serving plate and sprinkle over the lime juice, zest, vegetable oil, sesame seeds, sesame oil and soy sauce. Set aside to marinate for around 15 minutes - don't leave it any longer or the fish will begin to break down.
To serve, heat a griddle pan and chargrill the lime half, cut-side down, until lightly charred. Place the lime onto the serving plate and garnish with the tomatoes, dill and chives.
