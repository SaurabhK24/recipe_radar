Author: Nick Nairn

Ingredients:
1 duck breast, fat trimmed and skin scored

For the salad

2 large handfuls spinach
½ orange, peeled, segmented and chopped
½ shallot, sliced into rings
1 tsp sesame oil
½ orange, juice only
splash soy sauce
1 red chilli, finely sliced

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
Place a frying pan over a medium heat. Once hot, place the duck breast skin-side down into the pan. Cook for five minutes, until the skin is browned and crisp.
Drain some of the fat released from the duck and then turn the breast over and cook for a further three minutes, until the flesh has browned and then transfer into the oven to roast for ten minutes, or until cooked through.
Meanwhile place the salad ingredients into a large bowl and mix well.
To serve, slice the duck breast and place onto the salad.
