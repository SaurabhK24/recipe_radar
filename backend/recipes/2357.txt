Ingredients:

For the prawn skewer

3 raw tiger prawns, heads removed
1 lime, cut into wedges
dash olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the charred pepper

½ Romero pepper, seeds removed
dash olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the lime and chilli dressing

pinch dried chilli flakes
½ lime, juice only
3 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
1 tbsp chopped fresh flatleaf parsley

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
For the prawn skewer, thread the prawns and lime wedges (reserving some for garnish) alternately onto a wooden skewer. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Heat a griddle pan, add the skewer and griddle for four minutes on each side, or until the prawns are cooked through and the lime wedges are charred. Remove from the heat and keep warm.
For the charred pepper, place the pepper half onto a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Roast in the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until charred around the edges.
For the dressing, whisk the chilli flakes, lime juice, olive oil, salt and freshly ground black pepper, coriander and parsley together in a bowl until combined.
To serve, place the charred pepper onto a serving plate. Place the prawn skewer onto the charred pepper and drizzle with the dressing. Garnish with lime wedges.
