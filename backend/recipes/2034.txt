Ingredients:

For the roasted Romero pepper

1 Romero pepper, halved, seeds removed
1 tbsp olive oil
1 sprig fresh rosemary, leaves only
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the hot leek vinaigrette

25g/1oz butter
1 leek, finely chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 rashers streaky bacon, chopped
6 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp honey
1 tsp Dijon mustard
1 garlic clove, chopped
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp parmesan, finely grated, to serve

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
For the roasted Romero pepper, place the pepper halves onto a baking sheet, drizzle them with the olive oil, and sprinkle them with the rosemary leaves. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper, and roast in the oven for 15 minutes, or until the peppers have coloured and softened.
For the hot leek vinaigrette, melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat, add the leek, salt and freshly ground black pepper and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until softened.
Add the chopped bacon and fry until golden-brown. Remove from the heat and set aside.
In a small bowl, mix the olive oil, honey, mustard, garlic, and balsamic vinegar until well combined. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then pour the mixture over the leeks and bacon.
To serve, place the roasted pepper halves onto a serving plate, and pour the hot leek and bacon vinaigrette over them. Garnish with the grated parmesan.
