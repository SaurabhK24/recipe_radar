Ingredients:

For the balsamic haddock

1 tbsp olive oil
200g/7oz haddock, skin scored with a sharp knife
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar

For the spicy spinach

dash olive oil
¼ onion, finely sliced
½ red chilli, chopped
125g/4½oz baby spinach
salt and freshly ground black pepper
To serve

3 tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 tbsp Greek-style yoghurt
1 sprig fresh parsley, to garnish

Instructions:
For the haddock, heat the oil in a frying pan, season the haddock with salt and freshly ground black pepper and fry skin-side down for two minutes. Turn over, drizzle over the balsamic vinegar and cook for a further 1-2 minutes, or until just cooked through. Remove from the heat and set aside in a warm place.
For the spicy spinach, heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onion and fry over a low heat until softened but not coloured.
Add the chilli and fry for one minute. Add the spinach, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir until wilted. Drain off any excess liquid.
To serve, pour the balsamic vinegar into a small pan and simmer for five minutes, or until reduced and syrupy.
Pile the spicy spinach onto a serving plate, top with the haddock and pour the balsamic reduction around the plate. Top with a dollop of yoghurt and a sprig of parsley.
