Ingredients:

For the spiced blackened chicken

1 chicken breast
pinch chilli flakes
¼ tsp chilli powder
¼ tsp ground paprika
½ tsp dried oregano
¼ tsp ground cumin
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil

For the pineapple salsa

½ pineapple, finely chopped
1 lime, zest and juice only
pinch chilli flakes
½ red pepper, roasted and chopped

For the grilled sweet potatoes

2 small sweet potatoes, peeled
2 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
fresh chives, to garnish

Instructions:
For the spiced blackened chicken, place the chicken onto a chopping board and tap with a rolling pin or meat mallet to flatten slightly.
In a bowl, mix the spices and seasoning together, then dust the chicken in the spice mixture.
Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the chicken and fry skin-side down for 4-5 minutes. Turn and cook for 4-5 minutes on the other side, or until completely cooked through.
For the salsa, mix all the salsa ingredients together in a small bowl.
For the grilled sweet potatoes, cut the sweet potatoes into wedges and blanch in boiling salted water for 4-5 minutes. Drain and place into a bowl.
Drizzle the sweet potatoes in olive oil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Heat a griddle pan and cook the sweet potatoes for five minutes, turning occasionally, or until golden-brown on all sides and tender.
To serve, place the grilled sweet potatoes onto a serving plate, top with the blackened chicken and pour over the pineapple salsa. Garnish with chives.
