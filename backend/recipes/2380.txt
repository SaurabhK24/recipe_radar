Ingredients:
4 slices baguette
1 tbsp olive oil
200g/7oz smoked, peppered mackerel
1 small bunch fresh flatleaf parsley
8 plum tomatoes, quartered, seeds removed, finely chopped
1 tsp pine nuts, toasted
2 lemons, juice only
Â½ tsp sugar
pinch cayenne pepper
To serve

175g/6oz full fat cream cheese
1 lemon, juice only

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180C/365F/Gas 4.
Brush the slices of baguette with the olive oil. Place onto a baking tray and bake in the oven at 180C for 5-6 minutes, or until crisp and light golden-brown.
Break the mackerel into large chunks and place into a bowl, discarding any skin.
In a separate bowl mix the parsley, tomatoes and pinenuts.
In a clean bowl, mix the lemon, sugar and cayenne together, then pour over the parsley mixture. Mix to evenly coat in the dressing.
To serve, spread some of the cream cheese onto each slice of baguette. Place some of the mackerel on top and drizzle with a little lemon juice. Add a spoonful of parsley and tomato salad and serve.
