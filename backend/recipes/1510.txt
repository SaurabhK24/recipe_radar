Ingredients:
115g/4oz self-raising flour
pinch of salt
2 medium free-range eggs, beaten
300ml/Â½ pint milk
1 tbsp Dijon mustard
drizzle olive oil
1 Cumberland sausage
2 tbsp vegetable oil

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.
Place the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the middle.
In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs with the milk and mustard. Gradually pour the mixture into the well in the middle of the flour and whisk until you have a thick batter. Set aside and leave to rest for a few minutes while you cook the sausage.
Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a frying pan, add the sausage and fry until brown on all sides.
Pour the vegetable oil into a small gratin or pie dish and place in the oven until very hot. Place the sausage into the hot oil and pour over the batter. Place back in the oven and cook for 15 minutes, or until puffed up and golden-brown. Serve immediately in the gratin dish.
