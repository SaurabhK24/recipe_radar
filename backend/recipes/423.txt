Author: James Martin

Ingredients:
4 rainbow trout, gutted, fins trimmed
salt and freshly ground black pepper
50g/2oz butter
150g/5oz brioche breadcrumbs
200g/7oz French beans, trimmed
2 heads Little Gem lettuce, leaves separated

For the beurre noisette

110g/4oz unsalted butter
Â½ lemon, juice only
4 tbsp capers
4 tbsp flaked almonds, toasted

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
Season the inside of the trout with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Heat the butter in an ovenproof frying pan over a medium to high heat. When the butter is foaming, add the trout and fry for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until the skin is crisp and golden-brown and the flesh is almost cooked through.
Carefully remove the skin from both sides of the trout and sprinkle over the brioche crumbs.
Place the pan in the oven and bake for another 2-3 minutes or until the fish is cooked through.
Bring a pan of salted water to the boil, add the French beans and cook for 3-4 minutes until just tender.
Drain the beans and combine in a bowl with the Little Gem lettuce leaves.
For the beurre noisette, heat a frying pan until hot, add the butter and cook until it turns a nut-brown colour.
Add the lemon juice, capers, toasted almonds and a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper and then remove from the heat.
To serve, place the beans and Little Gem lettuce onto the plate. Top with the trout then spoon the beurre noisette around.
