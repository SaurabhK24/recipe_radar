Author: Alex Mackay

Ingredients:

For the duck

1 duck breast, skin on
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp honey
2 tbsp soy sauce
1 tsp sesame oil
1 plum, stone removed, chopped
pinch dried chilli flakes
To serve

2 Little Gem lettuces, leaves separated
½ potato, peeled, cut into 1cm/½in cubes, boiled until tender and drained

Instructions:
Score the skin of the duck breast with a sharp knife and season all over with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Place the duck breast skin-side down into a cold frying pan. Turn on the heat and bring up to a medium heat - this will allow the fat to render. Fry the duck for 10-12 minutes, draining off the fat into a bowl from time to time.
Turn the duck breast over. Add the honey, soy sauce, sesame oil, plum and chilli to the pan and simmer until slightly reduced, adding a splash of water if necessary. Cook the duck breast for another 2-4 minutes, or until cooked to your liking.
To serve, place the lettuce and potato onto a plate, top with the duck breast and drizzle over the pan juices.
