Ingredients:

For the pork chop

150g/5½oz pork chop
1 tbsp olive oil

For the pepper sauce

25g/1oz butter
½ red pepper, chopped
½ onion, sliced
1 tbsp tomato ketchup
30ml/1fl oz double cream
splash of white wine

Instructions:
Heat a griddle pan until smoking. Brush the pork chop with oil and add to the griddle to cook for six minutes. Turn the chop over and cook for a further six minutes, or until browned and cooked through. When cooked, the juices will run clear when pierced with a sharp knife. Remove from the heat and set aside to rest for three minutes.
For the pepper sauce, heat the butter in a pan over a medium heat. Once the butter has foamed, add the red pepper and onion and sauté for six minutes, until softened.
Transfer the red pepper and onion into a food processor and blend to a smooth purée. Add the tomato ketchup, cream and white wine and blend again briefly to mix.
To serve, place the pork onto a plate and drizzle over the pepper sauce.
