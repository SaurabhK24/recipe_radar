Author: Antony Worrall Thompson

Ingredients:

For the marinade

600ml/1 pint buttermilk
6 tbsp coriander, chopped
6 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 shallots, finely chopped
½ tsp dried chilli flakes
1 tbsp salt
4 chicken thighs, skinless

For the coating

6 tbsp plain flour
½ tsp celery salt
½ tsp cayenne pepper
½ tsp ground black pepper
½ tsp paprika
To cook the chicken

200ml vegetable oil

For the coleslaw

¼ red cabbage, finely shredded
¼ white cabbage, finely shredded
3 carrots, shredded
4 spring onions, chopped
1 tbsp caraway seeds
1 tbsp chilli sauce
100g/4oz mayonnaise
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
For the marinade, combine all the ingredients for the marinade and coat the chicken in a shallow dish. Cover and leave to marinate overnight in the fridge.
Combine all the ingredients for the coating. Remove the chicken from the marinade and dip into the spiced flour. Coat thoroughly and return to the fridge for a further 45 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
Heat the vegetable oil to in a deep heavy-bottomed saucepan, until a breadcrumb sizzles and browns when dropped in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous - do not leave unattended!). Add the chicken and fry until golden all over. Remove and place on a baking sheet.
Transfer to the oven and cook for 15-20 minutes until cooked through.
For the coleslaw, mix all of the ingredients together and season to taste.
