Ingredients:

For the butterflied lamb

1.8kg/4lb butterflied lamb leg, bone removed, cut into 2 equal pieces
3 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the romesco sauce

4 red peppers, grilled whole then peeled and seeds removed
4 tbsp blanched almonds, toasted
1 tbsp red wine vinegar
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the virgin paella

1 tbsp olive oil
1 white onion, chopped
425g/15oz rice
125ml/4fl oz white wine
1.35l/2 pints 7 fl oz chicken stock
6 saffron threads
salt
To garnish

lemon wedges
fresh parsley, chopped

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
To make the lamb, heat an oven-proof frying pan over high heat. Rub the lamb with the oil and season well. Put the lamb skin side down in the pan and sear for five minutes, then turn over and cook for a further two minutes.
Transfer the lamb to the oven and roast for 15 minutes.
Remove from the oven, cover loosely with foil and leave to rest for 10 minutes.
To make the romesco sauce, put all the ingredients in a blender and pulse until the sauce has combined but still has some texture.
For the virgin paella, heat the oil in a large, heavy-based deep frying pan or paella pan over a low-medium heat and cook the onion for five minutes until soft and golden.
Add the rice and cook for one minute, stirring to coat. Add the wine and cook for one minute.
Add the stock and saffron and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes or until the rice is just cooked.
Season with salt.
Slice the lamb thickly and serve with the romesco sauce, lemon wedges, parsley and the paella.
