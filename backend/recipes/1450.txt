1 x 400ml/14fl oz can coconut milk
2 lemongrass stalks, bruised with a knife
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the sea bass

1 tbsp green Thai curry paste

dash vegetable oil
knob of butter
100ml/4fl oz mirin
To serve

4 pak choi

Instructions:
For the rice, place the rice, coconut milk, lemongrass and seasoning into a saucepan. Bring to the boil, add a dash of water and cook for 12 minutes. Turn off the heat and cover with a lid. Set aside.
Meanwhile, fry the curry paste in a heavy-based frying pan for three minutes. Add the coconut milk and cook for a further three minutes.
Rub the sea bass with vegetable oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Heat a heavy-based frying pan and fry the sea bass, skin-side down, for two minutes and then cook for a further minute on the flesh side. Add the butter to the pan and remove from the heat.
Meanwhile blanch the pak choi in a pan of simmering vegetable stock for 2-3 minutes.
Spoon some of the rice into a cup or mould and turn it out onto a plate. Add a piece of pak choi on the side and spoon some of the curry sauce onto the plate.
Remove the fish from the pan with a fish slice and pat it dry onto kitchen paper. Brush the fish with mirin and serve on top of the rice. Squeeze over the lime juice and scatter with coriander leaves.
