100g/3½oz baby sweetcorn, cut in half lengthways
55g/2oz cashew nuts
150g/5oz duck breast, thinly sliced
1 tbsp honey
2 tsp soy sauce
½ tsp freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Heat the oil in a wok until smoking. Add the mangetout, sweetcorn and cashew nuts and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender but retaining a bit of bite.
