Place the butternut squash, garlic and thyme onto a baking sheet and drizzle with the olive oil. Place into the oven and roast for 10-15 minutes, until tender.
For the pine nut crust trout, place all of the crust ingredients, except the trout, in a food processor and blend to a smooth paste.
Place the trout onto a baking sheet, skin-side down and press the crust paste on top. Place into the oven and roast for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked.
For the sauce, heat the oil and garlic in a saucepan over a low heat for 2-3 minutes.
