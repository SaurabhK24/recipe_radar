Ingredients:

For the lamb

1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp coriander seeds
½ tsp paprika
½ tsp salt
1 tbsp olive oil
2 x 100g/3½oz lamb chops
1 tbsp wholegrain mustard, plus extra to serve
25g/1oz breadcrumbs
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives
1 tbsp chopped fresh chervil

For the kale

2 tbsp olive oil
1 garlic clove, peeled, sliced
2 handfuls kale, washed, thick stalks removed, roughly sliced, blanched for 2-3 minutes in salted water, drained
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
For the lamb, grind the cumin, coriander, paprika and salt in a pestle and mortar, then rub the mixture onto the lamb chops.
Mix together the mustard, breadcrumbs and herbs in a bowl until well combined.
Heat the oil in a pan over a medium heat and fry the lamb chops for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown. Press the mustard mixture onto one side of the lamb chop and continue to fry, with the mixture facing downwards, for 4-5 minutes, or until cooked to your liking.
For the kale, heat the oil in a wok over a medium heat and add the garlic. Stir-fry for one minute, then add the kale and stir-fry for 4-5 minutes, or until tender. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Serve the lamb chops on a plate with the kale and more wholegrain mustard.
