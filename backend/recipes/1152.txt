Ingredients:
3 lamb cutlets, flattened with the base of a saucepan or meat tenderiser
4 tbsp fresh breadcrumbs
1 tbsp finely chopped fresh mint
30g/1oz Wensleydale cheese with cranberries
1 tbsp butter, softened
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
In a hot griddle pan, fry the lamb cutlets for 30 seconds on both sides, until browned.
In a small bowl, mix the breadcrumbs, mint, Wensleydale cheese and butter together to make a rough paste. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Carefully remove the lamb cutlets from the griddle pan and press the breadcrumb mixture onto the cutlets.
Transfer the lamb cutlets to a baking sheet and roast for five minutes, or until cooked to your liking.
Set aside to rest for five minutes before serving.
