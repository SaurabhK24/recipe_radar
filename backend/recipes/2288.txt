Ingredients:

For the sauce vierge

3 tbsp olive oil
1 fresh tomato, seeds removed, chopped
1 lemon, juice only
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 tsp coriander seeds, ground in a pestle and mortar
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp chopped fresh dill
1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander leaves

For the seared sea bass

1 sea bass fillet
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil

For the beans

85g/3oz fine green beans, trimmed
1 tbsp olive oil

Instructions:
For the sauce vierge, place the oil, tomato, lemon juice, balsamic vinegar and ground coriander seeds into a pan and heat for 5-7 minutes. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, and add the fresh dill and coriander.
For the seared sea bass, lightly score the skin of the fish and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste. Heat the oil in a frying pan until hot, and quickly pan-fry the fish for about 1-2 minutes on each side or until cooked through.
For the beans, drop the beans into a pan of boiling salted water and cook for about three minutes, then drain. Heat the oil in a pan and fry the beans to colour slightly, for about two minutes.
To serve, place the beans on a serving plate, top with the seared bass, skin-side up, and spoon the sauce vierge around the edges of the plate.
