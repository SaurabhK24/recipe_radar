Ingredients:

For the pan-fried salmon

1 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp butter
85g/3oz salmon fillet
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the tarragon cream sauce

150ml/5fl oz double cream
150ml/5fl oz fish stock
2 tbsp chopped fresh tarragon
1 tbsp chopped fresh dill
To serve

3 asparagus spears, blanched
1 handful carrot batons, blanched

Instructions:
For the salmon, heat the olive oil and butter in a pan and season the fish with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Lay the fish skin-side down into the pan and fry for 4-5 minutes, then flip over and cook for a further 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown all over and cooked to your liking. Set aside on a warm plate.
For the sauce, place the cream and fish stock into a pan and bring to a gentle simmer. Reduce the mixture for 4-5 minutes, or until thickened slightly, then stir in the fresh herbs.
To serve, place the salmon onto a serving plate and arrange the blanched vegetables alongside. Pour the cream sauce around the edge of the plate.
