Ingredients:
12 large king prawns, shells on

For the stock

12 retained prawn shells
2 kaffir lime leaves
5 peppercorns

For the spice paste

1 garlic clove
2 lemongrass stalks, cut into inch-long pieces
thumb-sized piece of ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
1 red bird's-eye chilli
handful fresh coriander

For the prawns

1 tbsp olive oil
4 tbsp coconut milk
pinch salt
100g/3½oz mangetout, shredded lengthways
100g/3½oz beansprouts

Instructions:
First, prepare the stock. Remove the shells from the prawns and set the prawns aside. Place the shells in a small pan and cover with water. Add the lime leaves and peppercorns, then simmer over a gentle heat for five minutes.
For the spice paste, place the garlic, lemongrass, ginger and chilli into a small food processor and blend for a few seconds. Add the coriander and blend to a rough paste.
Strain the prawn stock through a sieve, discard the shells, then return the stock to the pan and keep warm.
For the prawns, pour the oil into a large, heavy-based saucepan over a medium heat, then add the spice paste. Fry gently for two minutes then add 300ml/½ pint of the stock.
Add the coconut milk, a generous pinch of salt, the mangetout and the prawns. Simmer for 3-4 minutes.
Divide the beansprouts between two large bowls, then spoon the prawn curry over the top, allowing the beansprouts to cook in the residual heat. Serve immediately.
