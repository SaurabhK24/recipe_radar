Ingredients:
675g/1lb 8oz cod fillet, 3cm/1¼in thick
85g/3oz white breadcrumbs, soft or slightly stale
3 tbsp parsley, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed
finely grated zest ½ lemon
60g/2¼oz butter, melted
a squeeze of lemon juice
salt and pepper
lemon wedges, to serve

Instructions:
Season the cod with salt and pepper to taste.
Mix the breadcrumbs with the parsley, garlic, lemon zest, salt and pepper, then add butter and lemon juice. Mix thoroughly with your fingers.
Place the cod in a shallow, ovenproof dish and press the buttered crumbs firmly onto the cod to form an even crust. Bake at 220C/425F/Gas 7 for 20-25 minutes until the crust is browned and the fish just cooked through. Serve immediately.
