Ingredients:

For the broth

1 tbsp olive oil
½ onion, chopped
500ml/18fl oz chicken stock
100g/3½oz basmati rice
½ carrot, peeled and chopped
½ courgette, chopped

For the chicken

1 tbsp olive oil
1 chicken thigh
salt and freshly ground black pepper
To serve

1 tbsp chopped fresh chives

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
For the broth, heat the oil in a pan over a medium heat and gently fry the onion for 3-4 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients and bring the mixture to the boil, then reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering and simmer for 10-12 minutes or until the rice is tender.
Meanwhile, for the chicken, heat the oil in an ovenproof pan over a medium heat. Season the chicken with salt and freshly ground black pepper and fry for 2-3 minutes, until golden-brown on all sides. Transfer to the oven and roast for 12-15 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. (The chicken is cooked through when the juices run clear when pierced in the thickest part with a skewer.)
To serve, slice the chicken thigh meat. Spoon the broth into a bowl and top with the chicken thigh slices. Garnish with the chopped chives..
