Ingredients:

For the salmon goujons

vegetable oil, for deep frying
100g/3½oz salmon fillet, skin removed
1 free-range egg, beaten
55g/2oz couscous

For the tomato salsa

1 tbsp olive oil
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
2 tomatoes, chopped
¼ tsp dried chilli flakes
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
chopped fresh parsley, to garnish

Instructions:
For the salmon goujons, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-based saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)
Slice the salmon into four long strips. Dip the salmon strips in the beaten egg.
Sprinkle the couscous onto a plate and coat the salmon slices in the couscous.
Carefully place the salmon into the hot oil and deep fry for about 3-4 minutes, or until crisp and cooked through. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.
For the tomato salsa, heat the oil in a frying pan. Add the garlic, tomatoes and chilli flakes and simmer for 2-3 minutes. Stir in the balsamic vinegar.
Serve the salmon goujons on a plate with the salsa and garnish with parsley.
