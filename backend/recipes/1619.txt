Author: James Martin

Ingredients:

For the salmon

500g/1lb 2oz salmon fillet, cut into thin slices
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the aster tripolium and scallop broth

75g/3oz butter
8 scallops, cleaned, corals separated from white meat, white meat thinly sliced
200g/7oz aster tripolium (a salt marsh plant occasionally available at fishmongers); you can substitute samphire if unavailable
150ml /5fl oz white wine
200ml/7fl oz double cream

Instructions:
Preheat the grill to high.
For the salmon, place the slices of salmon onto a grill tray lined with aluminium foil. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside.
For the aster tripolium and scallop broth, heat a frying pan until hot. Add half the butter and the slices of white scallop meat. Fry for one minute or until just cooked through (take care not to overcook the scallops or they will become tough and rubbery). Remove from the pan and set aside.
Add the aster tripolium or samphire to the same pan used to cook the scallops and fry for 2-3 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt the remaining butter in a clean frying pan over a medium heat. Add the scallop corals and fry for one minute. Add the white wine and bring to a simmer. Simmer until the volume of liquid is reduced by half.
Add the cream and bring back to a simmer for one minute.
Transfer the coral mixture to a blender and blend until smooth. Pour the blended coral cream into the pan containing the aster tripolium or samphire, add the slices of white scallop meat and gently heat through.
Meanwhile, for the salmon, place the salmon strips under the grill for 2-3 minutes or until just cooked through.
To serve, spoon the scallop broth onto each of four serving plates and top with the slices of salmon.
