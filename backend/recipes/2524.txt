Author: James Tanner

Ingredients:
1 tsp vegetable oil
85g/3oz piece of back bacon, cut into strips, or bacon lardons
2 thick slices bread
2 tbsp olive oil
100g/3½ oz blue cheese, crumbled
3 tbsp double cream
150g/5½ oz fresh spinach leaves
1 free-range egg

Instructions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a non-stick frying pan. Add the bacon and fry until golden. Remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Set aside and keep warm.
Heat a griddle pan. Generously drizzle both sides of the bread slices with olive oil, add to the griddle pan and cook on both sides until toasted and lightly charred. Remove from the pan and slice or tear into bite-sized pieces.
Place the cheese and cream into a small pan and over a low-medium heat and stir until the cheese has melted and the sauce is smooth.
Add the spinach leaves to the pan and stir until just wilted.
Transfer the creamy spinach to a serving plate and top with the bacon and croutons.
Bring a pan of water to the boil. Crack in an egg and reduce the heat to a simmer. Poach for four minutes then remove with a slotted spoon.
Serve the poached egg on top of the spinach and bacon salad and serve straightaway.
