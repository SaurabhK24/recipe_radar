Ingredients:

For the salmon

1 tbsp olive oil
100g/3½oz salmon fillet, skin on

For the spinach

25g/1oz butter
100g/3½oz spinach leaves
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the roasted tomatoes

2 tbsp olive oil
6 cherry tomatoes
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the pesto

75g/3oz pine nuts
3 tbsp olive oil
½ tsp salt
2 large handfuls fresh basil leaves
1 clove garlic, chopped

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
For the salmon, heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan until smoking and add the salmon, skin-side down. Fry for 2-3 minutes, or until the skin is crisp and golden. Turn the salmon over and fry for another 1-2 minutes, or until lightly golden. Transfer to the oven to cook for 6-7 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through.
For the spinach, melt the butter in a clean frying pan and cook the spinach for 3-4 minutes, or until wilted, then season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
For the roasted tomatoes, heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan. Add the tomatoes and stir to coat with the oil. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then place into the oven to roast for 5-6 minutes, or until softened.
For the pesto, place all of the pesto ingredients into a food processor and blend to a smooth paste.
To serve, pile the wilted spinach onto a serving plate and top with the seared salmon. Spoon the roasted cherry tomatoes alongside, then drizzle over the pesto dressing. Serve.
