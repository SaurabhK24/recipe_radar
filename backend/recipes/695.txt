Ingredients:

For the chilli pork skewers

150g/5Â½oz pork fillet, cut into 3 medallions
1 tsp dried chilli flakes
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil
2 tsp soy sauce
1 tsp Worcestershire sauce

For the tomato herb salad

2 fresh tomatoes, chopped roughly
1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
1 tbsp chopped fresh flatleaf parsley
1 tsp sesame seeds

Instructions:
For the pork skewers, sprinkle the medallions with the chilli flakes and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Drizzle over the olive oil and skewer each one with a bamboo skewer. Heat a griddle pan and griddle the pork until completely cooked through, about 2-3 minutes on each side.
Remove the skewers from the pan and add the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce to the pan. Bring to a simmer and scrape up the bits to make a dressing for the salad.
For the salad, combine all the ingredients in a bowl. Drizzle over the juices from the griddle pan and stir everything together to combine.
To serve, place the tomato salad onto a serving plate and arrange the pork skewers on top. Serve immediately.
