Ingredients:
1 leg of new season organic lamb, boned and butterflied (you can ask your local butcher to do this for you)

For the rose coating

1 small jar zucchero rosato (rose petal jam)
3 tbsp Dijon mustard
2 unwaxed lemons, grated zest only
generous bunch of fresh rosemary, stalks removed and leaves roughly chopped
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180C/356F/Gas 4.
For the rose coating, blend all of the ingredients together in a bowl, adding the olive oil last.
Season the lamb generously with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper and spread the rose coating all over the skin, using it all up.
Place the lamb in the preheated oven for 35 minutes.
Remove from the oven and allow to sit for 20 minutes before slicing and serving.
