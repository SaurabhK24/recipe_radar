Author: Paul Rankin

Ingredients:

For the monkfish

1 tsp chopped fresh rosemary
1 tsp chopped fresh parsley
1 tbsp olive oil
150g/7oz monkfish fillet
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 slices Parma ham

For the risotto

25g/1oz unsalted butter
1 tbsp olive oil
½ potato, peeled and chopped
½ onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
100g/3½oz risotto rice
50ml/2fl oz white wine
300ml/10fl oz hot chicken stock
55g/2oz peas, blanched
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
For the monkfish, mix the herbs with the oil in a bowl and add the monkfish. Mix well to coat and leave to marinate for 2-3 minutes.
Season the fish with salt and freshly ground black pepper and wrap with the Parma ham.
Heat an ovenproof frying pan and add the fillet. Cook for one minute on each side, until the ham has coloured, then transfer to the oven and roast for 6-8 minutes, or until completely cooked through.
For the risotto, melt the butter with the olive oil in a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the potato, onion and garlic and fry for two minutes.
Add the rice and the wine and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the wine is completely absorbed.
Add the stock and cook, stirring constantly, for eight minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed.
Add the peas and cook for a further two minutes, or until the rice is soft, but not mushy.
To serve, spoon the risotto onto a plate and place the monkfish on top.
