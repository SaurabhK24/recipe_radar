Ingredients:
6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
100g/3½oz pancetta or bacon, roughly chopped
800g/1lb 12oz pork fillet
2 garlic cloves, left whole
4 tbsp honey
1cm/½in fresh root ginger, peeled, finely sliced

4 baby parsnips, peeled, cut in half
4 shallots, halved or quartered, depending on size
2 sprigs fresh rosemary
300ml/10fl oz vegetable stock
freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Heat the olive oil in a lidded saucepan and fry the pancetta until golden-brown. Remove from the pan and set aside. Fry the pork in the same pan used to cook the pancetta for 4-5 minutes, or until browned all over.
Add the garlic, honey and ginger and continue to cook over a medium heat until caramelised.
Add the carrots, parsnips, shallots, rosemary, cooked pancetta, stock and black pepper, cover with a lid and cook on a medium to low heat for 30 minutes.
Check the vegetables are tender, remove them and set aside.
Continue to cook for another hour, or until the meat is tender and cooked through. Remove the pork from the pan and set aside to cool slightly. Carve into thick slices.
Return the vegetables and the pork slices to the pan to heat through before serving.
