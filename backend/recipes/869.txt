Ingredients:

For the fried noodles

300ml/10fl oz hot vegetable oil
150g/5&fra12;oz vermicelli noodles, cooked

For the skewers

2 king prawns, shell and head intact
2 bamboo shoots
1 tbsp vegetable oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the spring onion

1 red chilli, cut in half and de-seeded
1 spring onion, cut in half
1 tbsp vegetable oil
To garnish

1 lime cut into wedges

Instructions:
For the noodles, heat a heavy bottomed saucepan full of vegetable oil, until a breadcrumb sizzles in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous! Do not leave unattended.)
Dry the noodles with kitchen towel to get rid of any excess water.
Deep fry the noodles in the hot oil for 2-3 minutes, until golden. Remove carefully from the oil and drain on kitchen towels.
For the skewers, thread the prawns and bamboo shoots on skewers (slice the bamboo if required to fit onto skewers).
Place a griddle pan onto a high heat. Coat the prawns and bamboo shoots with the oil, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and place onto the hot griddle pan and season and cook for three minutes on each side, until the prawns are thoroughly cooked.
For the spring onion place them onto the griddle pan with the oil and cook until browned.
To serve place the crispy noodles on a plate. Top with the grilled spring onion and prawn skewers. Garnish with the lime wedges.
