Ingredients:
50ml/2fl oz extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
2 shallots, roughly chopped
110ml/4fl oz white wine
60g/2½oz white anchovy fillets, roughly chopped
1 free-range egg yolk
110ml/4fl oz double cream
freshly ground black pepper
To serve

selection of washed raw vegetables: celery, carrot sticks, cucumber sticks, radishes, strips of fennel, strips of peppers, cherry tomatoes on sticks, etc.

Instructions:
Heat a frying pan until hot, then add the olive oil, garlic and shallots. Cook for 1-2 minutes, to soften but not brown.
Add the anchovies and the wine and cook for a further 1-2 minutes, until the wine has reduced by half and the anchovies start to break down.
Transfer the anchovy mixture to a food processor, add the egg yolk and cream and blend to a paste.
Season with black pepper (the anchovies should make the dish salty enough) and pour into a serving bowl.
Serve immediately with a selection of washed raw vegetables for dipping.
