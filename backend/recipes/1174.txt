Author: James Martin

Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil
8 good-quality pork sausages
2 shallots, finely chopped
1 tsp roughly chopped fresh rosemary leaves
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes
125ml/4Â¼fl oz chicken stock
1 x 400g tin flageolet beans, drained and rinsed
1 tbsp roughly chopped fresh flatleaf parsley
4-6 thick slices sourdough bread
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.
Heat a tablespoon of the oil in an ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat. Add the sausages and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until browned on all sides. Transfer the pan to the oven and continue to cook for 10-12 minutes, or until cooked through.
Meanwhile, heat another tablespoon of the oil in a separate frying pan over a medium heat. Add the shallots and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until softened. Add the rosemary and garlic and fry for a further 1-2 minutes.
Add the chopped tomatoes and bring the mixture to the boil, then reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering. Add the stock and beans, return the mixture to a simmer and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.
Stir in the parsley and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Keep warm.
Just before serving, heat a griddle pan over a medium heat. Drizzle a little of the remaining tablespoon of oil onto each side of the bread slices. Grill the bread for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown chargrill marks appear on both sides.
To serve, place one slice of toast onto each serving plate. Spoon over the bean mixture and top each with a sausage or two.
