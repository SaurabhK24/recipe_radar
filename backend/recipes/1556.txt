Ingredients:
110g/4oz dried cranberries
55ml/2fl oz ruby port
45g/1½oz butter
1 small onion, chopped
2 rashers unsmoked green back bacon, cut into strips
2 garlic cloves, chopped
450g/1lb sausage-meat
85g/3oz soft white or brown breadcrumbs
2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
½ tsp fresh thyme leaves, chopped
150g/5½oz peeled, cooked chestnuts, roughly chopped
1 egg, lightly beaten
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Soak the cranberries in the port for an hour.
Melt the butter in a pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and bacon and cook gently until the onion is tender and the bacon is cooked.
Add the garlic and fry for another minute.
Remove from the heat to cool slightly, then pour into a bowl.
Add all of the remaining ingredients, including the cranberries and port, and mix well, adding enough egg to bind to form a thick paste.
Fry a small knob of the mixture to test for seasoning, and add salt and freshly ground black pepper to the mixture according to taste. The stuffing is now ready to use, to stuff turkey or chicken.
