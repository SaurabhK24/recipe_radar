Ingredients:

For the chicken

4 rashers smoked streaky bacon
1 chicken breast, cut into 4 strips
1 tbsp olive oil

For the red pepper chutney

1 tbsp olive oil
Â½ red pepper, chopped
2 tsp red wine vinegar
2 tsp caster sugar
1 tbsp tomato ketchup
dash Tabasco sauce
small handful fresh basil and mint, chopped

Instructions:
For the chicken, tightly wrap a bacon rasher around each chicken strip. Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the wrapped chicken strips for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown and completely cooked through.
For the chutney, heat the oil in a small saucepan over a medium heat and fry the peppers for 2-3 minutes. Add the vinegar, sugar, ketchup and Tabasco sauce and simmer for 6-8 minutes. Stir in the herbs.
To serve, place the bacon-wrapped chicken strips onto a serving plate with the chutney in a small bowl alongside.
