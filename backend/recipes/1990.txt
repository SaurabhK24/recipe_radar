Prep time: Less than 30 mins
Cook time: 10 to 30 mins
Serves: 4
Author: Valentina Harris

Ingredients:
2 small shallots, peeled and finely chopped
3 tbsp unsalted butter
350g/12oz carnaroli or vialone nano rice
1 glass dry white wine
up to 2 litres/3Â½ pints mild fish stock, kept hot
20 asparagus, steamed until just tender, spears removed
200g/7oz cooked peeled prawns
sea salt and freshly ground pepper
a few whole, hot, steamed asparagus and a handful of cooked, warm prawns, to garnish

Instructions:
Fry the shallots and the butter together until the shallots are cooked and soft but not browned. Add all the rice in one go and stir it around with the other ingredients to toast the grains thoroughly without browning.
After about 5 minutes of toasting, add the wine, and stir it in for about 2 minutes. Then add the first 3 ladles of hot stock and stir it through.
Continue to add the stock and stir it in each time the spoon opens up a clear wake behind it during the cooking process.
After about 15 minutes, which is five minutes from the end of the cooking time, add in the asparagus spears and the prawns and continue to cook the risotto, taking care not to destroy the asparagus spears or the prawns. Taste and season with salt and pepper to taste.
When the risotto is cooked (the rice grains are firm to the bite but cooked, and the texture is creamy), remove from the heat and stir in the rest of the butter. Cover and rest for 4 minutes, stir again and transfer to a warmed serving dish to serve at once, garnished with the extra asparagus and prawns.
