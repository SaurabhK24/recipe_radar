Ingredients:
2 tbsp vegetable oil
¼ red pepper, chopped
¼ onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed to a paste
pinch chilli flakes
100ml/3½fl oz white wine
100ml/3½fl oz double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper
5 fresh basil leaves, torn
1 sea bass fillet

Instructions:
Heat half of the oil in a pan and gently fry the pepper, onion and garlic for 3-4 minutes, or until softened, then stir in the chilli flakes.
Pour in the white wine and simmer for 8-10 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half, then stir in the cream and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Simmer gently for 1-2 minutes, then stir in the basil.
Heat the remaining oil in a pan, season the fish with salt and freshly ground black pepper and fry, skin-side down, for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Turn the fish over and fry for a further 1-2 minutes, or until the fish is golden-brown all over and cooked through.
To serve, spoon the pepper, chilli and basil cream onto a serving plate and place the fish on top.
