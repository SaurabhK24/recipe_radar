Ingredients:
1kg/2Â¼lb minced beef
1 large onion, grated
3 tbsp fresh parsley and thyme
salt and pepper, to taste

Instructions:
Preheat the barbecue to hot.
Place all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix together with a fork.
With wet (and clean) hands, shape the meat into flattish rounds of an equal depth to ensure even and thorough cooking.
Cook on the barbecue for approximately 5 minutes on each side - the burgers should be brown in the middle as well as on the outside.
