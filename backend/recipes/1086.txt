Ingredients:

For the grilled chicken

1 chicken breast
dash olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
85g/3oz feta cheese, crumbled
1 sprig fresh thyme, chopped
1 slice ciabatta, toasted

For the balsamic roast cherry tomatoes

85g/3oz cherry tomatoes on the vine
dash olive oil
dash balsamic vinegar

For the roast potatoes

2 new potatoes, halved
dash olive oil

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
For the chicken, heat a griddle pan. Rub olive oil onto the chicken breast, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste, and then place in the griddle pan skin-side-down for 4-5 minutes, or until golden. Turn over, top with the feta cheese and thyme and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place on a baking tray, transfer to the oven and bake for eight minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Place the chicken breast on a slice of toasted ciabatta.
For the roasted cherry tomatoes, place the tomatoes on a baking sheet, drizzle over the olive oil and roast for ten minutes. Add the balsamic vinegar and roast for a further 2-3 minutes.
For the roast potatoes, boil the potatoes in boiling salted water for ten minutes, or until softened, and drain. Heat a little olive oil in a frying pan and fry until golden.
To serve, place the chicken onto a serving plate, top with the roasted cherry tomatoes and serve the roasted potatoes on the side.
