Prep time: Less than 30 mins
Cook time: 10 to 30 mins
Serves: 2
Author: Neil Perry

Ingredients:
15 ripe cherry tomatoes
1 cup peas (gently braised for 15 minutes in extra virgin olive oil, anchovies and salt)
3 bintje potatoes, peeled and steamed (you can also use Yukon Gold or Yellow Finn potatoes)
1 large bunch mint
balsamic vinegar
extra virgin olive oil
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Slice the cherry tomatoes in half, cut the potatoes into large chunks and roughly slice the mint.
Simply mix the tomatoes, peas, potatoes and mint together.
Add 1 part balsamic vinegar to 2 parts olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper. (Be careful not to over season the salad as the anchovies cooked with the peas are quite salty themselves.)
