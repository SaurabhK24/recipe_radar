Ingredients:
2 duck crowns
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp Chinese five spice
340g/12oz baby turnips, peeled, trimmed
170g/6oz pitted green olives
1 shallot, finely chopped
125ml/4fl oz red wine
425ml/15fl oz chicken stock
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
55g/2oz butter
2 tbsp chopped chives

For the salad

340g/12oz cooked green beans
1 shallot, finely chopped
1 tsp mustard
2 tbsp white wine vinegar
4 tbsp olive oil
4 tbsp groundnut oil

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
Heat one tablespoon of the olive oil in a roasting tray, then sear the breasts of the duck crowns for about five minutes. Transfer to a plate and prick the skin (not deeply) of both duck crowns.
Mix the remaining oil with the Chinese five spice, brush this over the breasts and return the crowns to the roasting tray, reserving and refrigerating any juices on the plate.
Blanch the turnips for a few minutes in boiling, salted water, drain, pat dry and place in the roasting tray with the crowns.
Roast the crowns and turnips for 10 minutes, then add the olives and roast for a further 5-10 minutes.
Remove the crowns, olives and turnips from the oven and set aside in a warm place to rest.
Add the shallot to the oil in the tray and cook gently to brown them.
Pour off any excess fat. Add the wine and heat to reduce in volume by half.
Transfer the wine and shallots to a clean pan, add the stock and heat until the volume is reduced by two thirds.
Strain through a sieve into a clean pan, season and beat in the butter to make a sauce. Take the breasts off the bone. Add the turnips, olives, reserved juices from step two and the chives to the sauce and bring to the boil.
For the salad, mix together the beans and shallot. In a separate bowl, whisk together the remaining ingredients, season to taste and use this to dress the salad.
To serve, cut the breasts in two, serve with turnips and sauce poured around and salad alongside.
