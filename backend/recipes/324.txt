Ingredients:

For the roasted red pepper

½ red pepper, seeds removed, quartered
olive oil, for drizzling

For the salad

70g/2½oz pancetta lardons
1 avocado, stone removed, peeled and chopped
2 tsp balsamic vinegar
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the croutons

2 slices rustic white bread, roughly torn into bite-sized pieces
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
For the roasted red pepper, place the red pepper onto a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Transfer to the oven and roast for 8-10 minutes, or until lightly charred. Remove from the oven and chop roughly.
For the salad, heat a frying pan and fry the pancetta lardons until golden-brown and crisp. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.
Place the crisp pancetta into a salad bowl with the chopped avocado and roasted pepper pieces. Drizzle over the balsamic vinegar and olive oil, season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir.
For the croutons, place the bread into a large bowl, drizzle over the oil and stir to coat. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Spread the bread pieces out on a baking sheet, transfer to the oven and bake for five minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp.
To serve, sprinkle the croutons over the salad.
