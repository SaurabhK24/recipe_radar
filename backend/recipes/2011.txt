Ingredients:

For the salad

30g/1oz butter
bunch asparagus
salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 slices prosciutto
2 free-range eggs

For the hot chilli butter dressing

50g/1Â¾oz butter
pinch chilli flakes
pinch cayenne pepper
1 tsp tomato ketchup
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp chives, chopped

Instructions:
For the salad, melt the butter in a hot griddle pan, add the asparagus and griddle for five minutes, or until slightly charred on all sides.
Heat another non-stick frying pan, add the prosciutto and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until crisp.
Poach two eggs in a shallow pan of gently simmering water for four minutes, or until just cooked. To do this, gently swirl the pan of water to make a whirlpool and crack each egg individually into the middle of the whirlpool. Remove from the simmering water with a slotted spoon and set aside.
To make the dressing, melt the butter with the chilli flakes and cayenne pepper in a small saucepan. Stir in the ketchup and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Stir in the chives and remove from the heat.
To serve, pile the roasted asparagus onto a serving plate, top with the two poached eggs and the crisp prosciutto. Drizzle over the dressing and serve.
