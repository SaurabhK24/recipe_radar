Author: Mary Berry

Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil
2 large onions, sliced lengthways into wedges
2 red peppers, deseeded and diced
2 garlic cloves, chopped
1 tbsp chopped fresh thyme leaves
500g/1lb 2oz baby new potatoes, halved
12 sausages, pricked with a fork
200ml/7fl oz white wine
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 220C/200C fan/Gas 7.
Place all the ingredients except the wine in a large, resealable freezer bag. Seal the bag shut and shake well to coat everything in the oil. Alternatively, put everything in a large bowl and turn the ingredients until they are fully coated in the oil.
Tip into a large roasting tin, spreading the ingredients out into one even layer and ensuring that the sausages aren’t covered by any of the vegetables. Season well with salt and pepper. Roast for about 30–35 minutes until golden-brown.
Remove from the oven, turn the sausages over and toss the vegetables in the cooking juices. Pour in the wine and return to the oven for a further 20 minutes or until browned and the sausages are cooked and the potatoes tender.
Serve hot with a dollop of mustard on the side.
