Author: Nick Nairn

Ingredients:
dash olive oil
1 bunch asparagus, woody ends removed
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp duck fat
1 free-range egg
1 large handful fresh parsley, chopped
1 large handful fresh coriander, chopped
1 large handful fresh basil, chopped
squeeze lemon juice
Â¼ red chilli, sliced

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
Heat a dash of olive oil in an ovenproof frying pan, add the asparagus and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fry for 3-4 minutes, then transfer the pan into the oven and roast for ten minutes, shaking the pan occasionally to ensure that the asparagus is evenly cooked. Remove from the oven and set aside.
Heat the duck fat in a frying pan, crack in the egg and fry for 1-2 minutes, or until cooked to your liking.
Toss the herbs in a bowl with the lemon juice, chilli and a dash of olive oil. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To serve, pile the herb salad onto a serving plate, place the roasted asparagus next to the salad and top with the fried egg.
