Ingredients:

For the pancakes

115g/4oz plain flour
2 tsp baking powder
1 free-range egg, beaten
150ml/¼ pint milk
1 tbsp white crabmeat
50g/2oz cooked brown shrimps, shells removed
1 spring onion, finely chopped
1 red chilli, finely chopped
1 tbsp olive oil

For the spicy tomato sauce

1 tbsp olive oil
½ onion, finely chopped
1 red chilli, finely chopped
½ tsp tamarind paste
1 tbsp soft brown sugar
200g/7oz canned cherry tomatoes
2 tsp red wine vinegar
handful fresh coriander leaves, chopped

Instructions:
For the pancakes, place the plain flour and baking powder into a large bowl, add the egg and milk and whisk to make a thick smooth batter. Stir in the crabmeat, shrimps, spring onion and red chilli.
Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and pour in three separate spoonfuls of batter to make three small pancakes. Cook for 2-3 minutes, then turn over using a spatula and cook for 2-3 minutes on the other side. Remove the pancakes from the pan and repeat with the rest of the mixture. Pile the pancakes onto a plate and keep warm.
For the tomato sauce, heat the olive oil in a pan, add the onion and sauté for 3-4 minutes. Add the chilli and fry for one minute. Add the tamarind paste, sugar, cherry tomatoes and vinegar and cook for five minutes. Stir in the coriander.
To serve, spoon the sauce onto serving plates and top with the pancakes.
