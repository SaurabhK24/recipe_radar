Ingredients:

For the crushed potato tower

25g/1oz unsalted butter
1 tbsp olive oil
100g/3½oz new potatoes, boiled until tender, drained
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the spinach

25g/1oz unsalted butter
1 tbsp olive oil
50g/1¾oz spinach
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the scallops

1 tbsp olive
3 scallops, cleaned
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
For the potato tower, place the butter, olive oil and boiled potatoes into a bowl and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Crush the potatoes roughly, with the back of a spoon, then spoon the potato into a 2in/5cm oiled chefs ring on a plate and level the top with a palette knife.
For the spinach, place a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the butter and olive oil and stir until melted. Add the spinach and cook until the spinach has wilted. Squeeze out the excess moisture then season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
For the scallops, heat a saucepan over a high heat. Rub the scallops with the oil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place the scallops into the saucepan and fry for two minutes on each side, or until completely cooked through.
To serve, place the potato tower onto a serving plate and carefully remove the chefs ring. Spoon the spinach alongside and arrange the scallops on top of the spinach.
