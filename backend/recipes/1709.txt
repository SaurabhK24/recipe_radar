Prep time: Less than 30 mins
Cook time: Over 2 hours
Serves: 4
Author: Gennaro Contaldo

Ingredients:
12 small sirloin steaks
30g/1oz parmesan cheese, grated
4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
handful flatleaf parsley, torn
salt and freshly ground pepper
6 tbsp olive oil
150ml/¼ pint red wine
1 onion, finely chopped
1 celery stalk, very finely chopped
2 tbsp tomato purée, diluted in 400ml/14fl oz lukewarm water
2x400g cans chopped tomatoes
handful fresh basil leaves, torn

Instructions:
Arrange the slices of meat on a chopping board or a clean work surface and flatten them with a meat tenderiser (if you don't have one, place a flat wooden spatula over the meat and bash with the palm of your hand). Season with salt and pepper, then sprinkle with the grated parmesan, garlic, and parsley. Roll each slice up tightly and secure well with toothpicks.
For the sauce, heat the olive oil in a large saucepan. When hot, lower the heat, add the meat rolls and seal well on all sides. Increase the heat again, add the wine and simmer until it has reduced by half. Remove the meat and set aside.
Add the onion and celery to the pan and stir well. Cook until the remainder of the wine has nearly evaporated, then put the meat back in the pan and pour over the diluted tomato concentrate and the chopped tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper and stir in the basil. Lower the heat and cover with a lid, but not completely, so some of the steam can escape. Cook gently for 2 hours, stirring from time to time. Check the seasoning.
Serve the tomato sauce with some cooked pasta such as tagliatelle or large rigatoni. Then serve the meat rolls as a main course with a mixed leaf salad.
