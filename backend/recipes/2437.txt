Ingredients:
225g/8oz dried spaghetti
1 tbsp olive oil
150g/5oz smoked pancetta, cubed
1 garlic clove
2 free-range eggs
150ml/5fl oz double cream
100g/3Â½oz pecorino or parmesan, grated
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp chopped fresh marjoram leaves or flatleaf parsley
handful rocket leaves, lightly dressed with olive oil and lemon juice, to serve

Instructions:
Boil the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water according to packet instructions.
Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat and fry the pancetta and garlic for 2-3 minutes, until the pancetta is crisp and browned. Reduce the heat to low.
In a bowl, lightly beat the eggs with the cream and most of the grated cheese, reserving a little cheese for the garnish. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper.
Drain the cooked spaghetti, reserving a few tablespoons of the cooking water.
Tip the spaghetti into the pan with the pancetta and pour in the cream and egg mixture. Mix well over a very low heat, adding a little of the reserved pasta water to loosen the mixture if needed.
Divide the pasta between two serving bowls and sprinkle with the remaining cheese and the chopped herbs. Serve immediately with the rocket salad on the side.
