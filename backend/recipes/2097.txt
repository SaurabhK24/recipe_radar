Ingredients:

For the rolled haddock

200g/7oz haddock fillet
small handful baby spinach
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil

For the rice

1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing
½ onion, finely chopped
½ red chilli, finely chopped
85g/3oz jasmine rice, cooked
small handful baby spinach, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the chilli oil dressing

3 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp white wine vinegar
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
¼ red chilli, chopped
1 lime, juice only

Instructions:
For the haddock, place the haddock fillet onto a clean work surface and spread the spinach and garlic over it. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and roll the fillet up. Secure with a cocktail stick. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place in a steamer and steam for 6-8 minutes, or until cooked through.
For the rice, heat the olive oil in a saucepan, add the onion and chilli and fry until softened but not coloured.
Add the cooked rice and warm through. Add the chopped spinach, salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir over a low heat for one minute. Lightly oil a small ramekin and fill with the cooked rice, pressing it down. Turn out onto a serving plate.
For the dressing, whisk all the ingredients together in a small bowl.
To serve, place the rolled haddock next to the rice on the serving plate and pour over the dressing.
