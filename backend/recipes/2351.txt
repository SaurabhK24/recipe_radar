Author: Gennaro Contaldo

Ingredients:

For the steak

4 x/150g/6oz sirloin steaks, thinly cut
3 tbsp olive oil

For the sauce

2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
6 anchovy fillets
2 tbsp capers, rinsed and drained
handful fresh flatleaf parsley, finely chopped
1 x 400g/14oz can plum tomatoes
2 tbsp dried oregano

For the couscous

200g/7oz couscous
1 red pepper, finely chopped
1 large shallot, finely chopped
1 lemon, juice only
2 tbsp olive oil
3 tbsp chopped fresh flatleaf parsley

Instructions:
Heat a frying pan until hot, add the olive oil and steaks and fry on each side until golden-brown. Remove the steaks and set aside on a plate.
In the same pan, add the garlic, anchovies, capers and half of the parsley and fry for 2-3 minutes.
Add the tomatoes and oregano and cook for one minute over a high heat, stirring well.
Lower the heat and return the steaks and any juices collected on the plate to the pan and stir to make sure they are covered with the sauce. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the steaks are tender and cooked to your liking.
For the couscous, place the couscous into a bowl and pour over enough boiling water to cover by 1cm/Â½in. Stir well then cover with cling film and leave for 3-5 minutes. Remove the cling film and stir well with a fork.
Add the remaining couscous ingredients and mix well.
To serve, spoon equal amounts of couscous onto each plate. Place a steak onto each portion of couscous and spoon the sauce over.
