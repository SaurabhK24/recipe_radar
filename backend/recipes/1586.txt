Author: Lesley Waters

Ingredients:

For the bacon and potato rösti

1 tbsp olive oil
200g/7oz smoked bacon, fat removed, chopped
½ baking potato, peeled and grated

For the fried egg

1 tbsp olive oil
1 free-range egg
sprinkling freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
For the bacon and potato rösti, heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and fry the bacon pieces for 5-6 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown.
Put the grated potato into a clean tea towel and bring the edges of the tea towels together to form a parcel. Wring the grated potato in the tea towel until as much moisture as possible has been extracted.
Add the grated potato to the frying pan with the bacon, and mix well to combine.
Press the potato mixture down into the pan with a spatula or fish slice. Fry over a medium heat for 5-6 minutes on each side, until golden-brown and crisp on both sides.
For the fried egg, heat the oil in a frying pan over a high heat, add the egg and fry until it has just set. Sprinkle the freshly ground black pepper over the egg.
