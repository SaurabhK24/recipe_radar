For the dressing

2 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp wholegrain mustard
½ lemon, juice only
100g/3½oz cream cheese
1 tbsp clear honey
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the salad

¼ fennel bulb, thinly sliced
100g/3½oz new potatoes, boiled, drained, cooled and quartered
4 asparagus spears, blanched, refreshed in cold water and chopped
75g/2¾oz smoked salmon, thinly sliced

For the poached egg

1 free-range egg
1 tbsp white vine vinegar
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
For the dressing, place all of the dressing ingredients into a bowl and whisk together, then season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
For the salad, place the fennel, potato and asparagus into the bowl with the dressing and mix well to coat.
For the poached egg, fill a small frying pan with water and bring to a simmer. Add the vinegar to the pan, then gently crack the egg into the water. Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the egg white has set.
Remove the egg from the water using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.
To serve, place the salad onto a plate with the salmon and poached egg on top.
