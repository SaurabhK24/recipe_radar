Ingredients:
250g/9oz butter
1 bunch of dill
2 lemons
2 tsp green peppercorns in brine
640g/1lb5½oz sea trout fillets
salt and pepper

Instructions:
Grate the zest of the lemons then peel them with a knife and segment them, so you are left with only the flesh (no pips).
Finely chop the dill.
Cut the trout into 2.5cm/1in cubes roughly.
Melt the butter in a pan and gently stew the trout until the cubes are nearly cooked then add the lemon zest, segments, dill and peppercorns. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon into ramekin dishes and chill for at least 6 hours.
To serve, remove from the ramekin and garnish with a spoon of crème fraîche and toast.
