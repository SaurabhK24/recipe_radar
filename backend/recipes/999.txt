Ingredients:

For the pasta

200g/2oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting
2 large free-range eggs

For the sauce

2 tbsp olive oil
½ chicken breast, skin removed, sliced into strips
½ red onion, sliced into thin wedges
1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed
100ml/3½fl oz white wine
200ml/7fl oz double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper
small bunch fresh basil, chopped
55g/2oz parmesan cheese, grated

Instructions:
For the pasta, place the flour into a food processor, crack in the eggs and blend together until dough is formed. Tip onto floured work surface and knead for a few minutes. Cover with cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for one hour.
Remove the dough from the fridge. Slice in half. Roll out one piece very thinly on a floured work surface and then slice long thin strips. Repeat with the other half of pasta dough.
For the sauce, heat the oil in a saucepan. Add the chicken and onion and sauté for 3-4 minutes until the chicken is just cooked through. Add the garlic, wine and cream. Lower the heat and cook until the sauce has thickened. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then stir in the chopped basil and parmesan cheese.
Cook the pasta in boiling salted water for 2-3 minutes, drain and add to the sauce. Coat well and then spoon onto a serving plate or pasta bowl. Serve immediately.
