Ingredients:

For the duck au poivre

½ duck breast, skin scored with a sharp knife
salt and freshly ground black pepper
50ml/2fl oz red wine
100ml/3½fl oz double cream
1 tsp black peppercorns, crushed

For the herb rice

100g/3½oz basmati rice
1 tbsp butter, melted
1 tbsp finely chopped fresh parsley
75g/2¾oz Tenderstem broccoli, blanched, to serve

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
Season the duck well with salt and freshly ground black pepper and place skin-side down in a small ovenproof frying pan. Place over a medium heat and fry on both sides until browned.
Transfer to the oven and roast for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked to your liking. Remove the duck from the pan and transfer to a board to rest.
Return the pan to the heat and pour in the wine. Bring to a simmer, scraping up the bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Simmer until reduced by half, then stir in the cream and black pepper. Simmer gently until needed.
For the herb rice, place the basmati rice into a small saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil and simmer for 8-10 minutes, or until tender. Drain off any excess liquid.
Brush the inside of a deep ramekin dish with the melted butter. Place the chopped parsley into the ramekin and tip it around to coat the buttered sides with the parsley.
Tip the excess herbs and butter into the drained rice and mix well, then pack the rice into the ramekin.
To serve, slice the duck into four and arrange on a serving plate. Turn out the ramekin of herb rice onto the plate. Serve with broccoli and pour the sauce over the duck.
