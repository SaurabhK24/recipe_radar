Heat the oil or ghee in a deep frying pan or saucepan over a medium heat and cook the onion for 6-7 minutes until softened and becoming golden. Add the chicken and fry for 3-4 minutes until it has become opaque in colour. Stir in the Madras paste and cook for a couple of minutes before adding the chopped tomatoes and coconut.
