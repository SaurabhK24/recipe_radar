Ingredients:

For the salmon

2 slices white bread
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley leaves
salt and freshly ground black pepper
85g/3oz salmon fillet, skin removed
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp butter

For the dressing

1 lemon, juice only
3 tbsp olive oil
3 tbsp chopped mixed fresh herbs
salt and freshly ground black pepper
To serve

3 asparagus spears, woody ends removed, split lengthways and blanched
1 carrot, grated
1 handful pine nuts, toasted

Instructions:
For the salmon, place the bread, parsley, salt and freshly ground black pepper into a food processor and pulse until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Transfer onto a plate, then roll the salmon fillet in the mixture until well coated. Pat lightly to secure the breadcrumbs to the fish, then gently shake off any excess.
Heat the olive oil and butter in a pan and fry the salmon for 3-4 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown all over and cooked to your liking.
For the dressing, combine all of the dressing ingredients in a bowl and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To serve, place the grated carrot on a serving plate and place the salmon on top. Spoon the blanched asparagus alongside, drizzle over the dressing and scatter over the pine nuts.
