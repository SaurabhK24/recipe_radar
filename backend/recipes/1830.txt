Ingredients:

For the pork

1 tbsp olive oil
150g/5oz pork fillet
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the leeks

1 tsp olive oil
knob unsalted butter
1 garlic clove, peeled and chopped
½ leek, washed and sliced
2 sprigs of thyme, leaves only
50ml/2fl oz milk
150ml/5fl oz double cream
1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.
For the pork, heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan. Season the pork fillet and sear in the hot pan for 1-2 minutes on each side. Transfer to the oven and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through.
For the leeks, heat the oil and butter in a pan and sauté the garlic with the leek and thyme leaves for 3-4 minutes, to soften.
Stir in the milk, cream and parsley, then reduce the heat and simmer gently for a further 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Remove the pork from the oven and allow to rest. Slice on the diagonal. Spoon the creamed leeks onto a serving plate and top with the sliced pork.
Serve.
