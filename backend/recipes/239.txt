Author: Michel Roux Jr.

Ingredients:
480g/1lb 1oz tuna loin (preferably yellow fin, as fresh as possible)
2 spring onions, thinly sliced
1 medium-hot red chilli, finely chopped
2.5cm/1in piece fresh root ginger, peeled and grated, or finely diced
1 tbsp clear honey
6 tbsp light soy sauce
1 lime, juice only
2 tbsp sesame oil
2 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted
4 slices ciabatta
few sprigs fresh coriander, to garnish

Instructions:
Remove and discard any dark parts from the bloodline of the tuna. Finely dice the remaining tuna and place in a large bowl. Stand the bowl on ice to keep chilled.
Add the spring onions, chilli and ginger to the tuna and mix well.
In a separate bowl mix together the honey, soy sauce, lime juice, sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds.
Toast the slices of ciabatta on a griddle pan.
To serve, press the tuna tartare into a 7cm/3in chefâ€™s ring on each serving plate. Carefully remove the ring, arrange the toast and lime wedges around the tartare.
