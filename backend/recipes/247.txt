Ingredients:

For the turkey escalope

1 x 150g/5½oz piece turkey breast
1 tbsp olive oil
3 fresh sage leaves

For the sauce vierge

1 tbsp olive oil
½ lemon, juice only
1 tomato, seeds removed, chopped
handful fresh parsley, chopped
handful fresh chives, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
For the turkey escalope, place the turkey breast between two sheets of cling film and flatten with a rolling pin or the base of a frying pan.
Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and cook the escalope with the sage leaves for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until completely cooked through. Remove the turkey from the pan and set aside to keep warm.
For the sauce vierge, in the same pan heat the remaining olive oil with the lemon juice, chopped tomato and herbs until simmering. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To serve, place the turkey escalope onto a serving plate and drizzle over the sauce vierge.
