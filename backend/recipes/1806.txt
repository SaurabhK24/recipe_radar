Instructions:
For the pork, heat the olive oil in a frying pan. Add the pork, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and fry until golden-brown on both sides.
Add the cream, mustard and white wine and simmer gently for five minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly. Remove from the heat and keep warm.
For the tomatoes, heat the olive oil in a pan, add the onion and fry for 3-4 minutes over a gentle heat, until softened but not coloured. Add the garlic and fry for one minute.
Add the chopped tomato, red wine vinegar and ketchup and simmer for five minutes. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
For the rice, cook the rice according to the packet instructions and then drain.
Heat the olive oil in a saucepan, add the cooked rice, chopped fig, tomato, basil, salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir well over a low heat until warmed through.
To serve, pack the rice into a lightly greased ramekin, then turn out onto a serving plate. Place the pork chop next to the rice and pour over the mustard sauce from the pan. Spoon the sweet and sour tomatoes on the side and serve.
