Author: Simon Rimmer

Ingredients:
4 x 150g/5oz hot smoked (i.e. cooked) salmon fillets
4 tbsp clear honey
1 tbsp soy sauce

For the dressing

5cm/2in piece fresh ginger, peeled, grated
200g/7oz read-made mayonnaise
2½ tbsp light soy sauce
1 tsp sugar
1 tbsp rice vinegar
2 tsp water

For the salad

400g/14oz baby spinach leaves
100g/3½oz sun-blushed tomatoes
50g/2oz pine nuts, toasted
4 spring onions, finely sliced
To serve

1 lime, cut into wedges
small bunch coriander, leaves only

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180C/360F/Gas 4.
For the salmon, place the honey and soy sauce into a pan and bring to the boil. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until thickened and combined.
Brush the honey and soy sauce mixture onto the salmon fillets. Transfer to a baking tray and place into the oven for 5-6 minutes, to warm through.
For the dressing, place the ginger into a piece of clean muslin and squeeze out the juice into a bowl.
Add the mayonnaise, soy sauce, sugar and rice vinegar to the ginger juice and mix well.
Add a little water if the mixture is too thick - it should be the consistency of double cream.
For the salad, place the spinach leaves, tomatoes, pine nuts and spring onions into a large bowl and mix well.
To serve, place equal amounts of salad mixture into four bowls. Spoon some of the dressing onto each portion and place a piece of salmon on top.
Garnish with lime wedges and sprinkle with coriander leaves.
