Ingredients:
5 kaffir lime leaves (frozen, fresh or dried)
½ chicken stock cube, dissolved in 300ml/10½fl oz just-boiled water
275g/9¾oz long-grain or basmati rice
2 tbsp sunflower oil
2 chicken breasts, boned, skinned, cut into small pieces
1 large red pepper, cored, deseeded and cut into 2cm/¾in chunks
200g/7oz fine green beans, trimmed, halved lengthways
200g/7oz baby sweetcorn, trimmed, halved diagonally
2 tbsp Thai red curry paste
1 tbsp Thai fish sauce (nam pla)
2 tsp cornflour
50g/1¾oz fresh spinach leaves
large handful fresh basil leaves (optional)

Instructions:
Stir the lime leaves in to the stock and set aside to infuse.
Meanwhile, half-fill a large saucepan with water and bring to the boil. Add the rice, stir well and return to the boil, then cook according to the packet instructions.
Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan or wok over a high heat. Add the chicken, red pepper, green beans and baby sweetcorn and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes.
Add the curry paste and cook for a further 1-2 minutes.
Add the stock, lime leaves and fish sauce, bring the mixture to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 2-3 minutes, or until the vegetables are just tender.
In a small bowl, whisk the cornflour with 1 tbsp cold water to form a smooth paste. Whisk into the curry and continue to simmer for 4-5 minutes, or until the curry sauce has thickened slightly.
Stir in the spinach and continue to simmer until just wilted. Stir in the basil leaves just before serving. Discard the lime leaves.
To serve, drain the rice and spoon it onto serving plates. Top each portion with a ladleful of the curry.
