Ingredients:

For the vichy carrots

5 baby carrots, trimmed and left whole
1 tbsp caster sugar
25g/1oz butter
splash boiling water

For the lamb

2 tbsp olive oil
2 lamb cutlets
1 tbsp Dijon mustard
25g/1oz butter
55g/2oz goats' cheese
1 tbsp chopped fresh thyme

For the onion marmalade

25g/1oz butter
1 red onion, chopped
2 tbsp demerara sugar
3 tbsp balsamic vinegar

Instructions:
For the carrots, place all of the carrot ingredients into a small pan with a tight fitting lid and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook with the lid on for 6-8 minutes, or until the carrots are tender.
For the lamb, heat the olive oil in an ovenproof frying pan and sear the cutlets on both sides for one minute. Mash together the remaining lamb ingredients in a bowl and spread onto the seared cutlets, then transfer to the oven to cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the crust is golden-brown.
For the onion marmalade, melt the butter in a small pan and gently fry the onion with the sugar for 3-4 minutes, or until softened. Add the balsamic vinegar and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until the mixture is thick and sticky.
To serve, spoon the onion marmalade onto a serving plate and place the lamb on top. Serve the carrots alongside.
