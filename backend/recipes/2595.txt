Ingredients:

For the sticky soy and sesame chicken

2 chicken thighs
2 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp clear honey
2 limes, halved
2 garlic cloves, crushed
Â½ tsp chilli flakes
2 tbsp olive oil

For the spinach salad

1 large handful spinach, washed
5-6 drops Tabasco sauce
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp sesame seeds
dash olive oil

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
Place the chicken thighs into a non-reactive dish, add the soy sauce, honey, juice from the limes, garlic, chilli flakes and half of the olive oil and mix together. Set aside the squeezed lime halves. Leave to marinate for five minutes, or up to thirty minutes if time permits.
Heat an oven-proof frying pan, add the remaining olive oil, add the chicken and squeezed lime halves and fry for three minutes on one side, or until turning golden. Turn the chicken over and place the oven-proof frying pan into the preheated oven. Cook the chicken for 15 minutes, or until it is cooked through.
To make the salad, place the spinach, Tabasco sauce, soy sauce and sesame seeds into a large bowl and mix together.
To serve, pile the spinach salad onto a serving plate and top with the chicken and lime halves.
