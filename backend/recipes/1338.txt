Ingredients:

For the pilaf

1 tbsp olive oil
½ onion, chopped
½ roasted red pepper, chopped
150ml/5fl oz chicken stock
75g/2½oz basmati rice
25g/1oz peas
25g/1oz cooked brown shrimps

For the lemon sole

vegetable oil for greasing
1 lemon sole fillet, skin removed, cut in half lengthways

For the sauce

1 tbsp olive oil
1 roasted red pepper, chopped
3 tbsp cooked brown shrimps
2 tbsp Greek-style yoghurt
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
1 tbsp chopped fresh dill

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
For the pilaf, heat the oil in a saucepan over a medium heat and gently fry the onion and pepper for 3-4 minutes, or until softened.
Pour in the stock, bring to the boil and add the rice. Stir well, then reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering, cover the pan with a lid, and simmer, for 10-12 minutes or until the rice is tender. Stir in the peas and shrimps.
For the lemon sole, grease a baking tray and a 10cm/4in metal ring mould with the oil. Place the ring mould onto a baking tray and line it with the sole fillets to create a ring of fish.
Bake in the oven for 3-4 minutes, remove and pack the pilaff into the centre of the ring, then return to the oven to cook through for a further 4-5 minutes.
For the sauce, heat the oil in a saucepan and fry the pepper in the oil for 3-4 minutes. Add the shrimps and warm through, then stir in the yoghurt, dill and parsley.
To serve, place the timbale of sole and rice in the middle of a plate. Carefully remove the ring mould. Spoon the sauce around the edge.
