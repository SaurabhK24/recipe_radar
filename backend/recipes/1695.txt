Ingredients:
150g/5½oz lean beef mince
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the guacamole

1 ripe avocado, peeled, stone removed, chopped
½ lime, juice only, plus extra to serve
1½ tbsp chopped fresh coriander leaves
To serve

2 flour tortillas
3 tbsp plain yoghurt
1 Little Gem lettuce, leaves separated

Instructions:
Mix the beef mince, garlic, salt and pepper together in a bowl. Then roll the mince into about 6 balls using your hands. Rub the beef with olive oil. Cook in a hot frying pan for 8-10 minutes, turning regularly, until golden-brown and cooked through.
For the guacamole, put all of the guacamole ingredients in a bowl and mash to a rough mixture with a fork.
Spread the tortillas with the guacamole, fill with the hot beef and add some yoghurt. Squeeze over a little more lime juice to taste, add a few lettuce leaves, then roll the tortilla up.
