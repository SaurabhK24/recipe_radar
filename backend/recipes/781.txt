Ingredients:

For the red onion and plum relish

1 tbsp olive oil
½ red onion, chopped
3 plums, stones removed, roughly chopped
2 tbsp brown sugar
1 tbsp clear honey
2 tbsp red wine vinegar
1 lime, juice only

For the omelette

15g/½oz butter
3 large free-range egg, beaten
2 slices ham, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley

Instructions:
For the red onion and plum relish, heat the oil in a frying pan. Add the red onion and plums and fry over a high heat. Add the remaining relish ingredients to the pan and simmer for five minutes until softened.
Spoon the relish into a small serving bowl and leave to cool while you prepare the omelette.
For the omelette, melt the butter in a small frying pan.
Mix the beaten egg with the chopped ham in a small bowl and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Add the egg mixture to the pan and mix with a wooden spoon until it starts to set around the edge of the pan. Leave to cook over a low heat until it has completely set. Carefully flip the omelette out onto a plate and slice into wedges.
Serve the omelette with the relish on the side, garnished with chopped parsley.
