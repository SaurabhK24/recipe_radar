50g/2oz couscous, cooked according to instructions on packet
2 tbsp fresh chives, chopped

1 tbsp olive oil
150g/5¼oz salmon fillet, skinless
1 free-range egg, beaten
2 tbsp vegetable oil

For the salsa

¼ mango, peeled and cut into cubes
1 tomato, de-seeded and chopped

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.
Mix the couscous, chives, salt and freshly ground black pepper and olive oil in a bowl.
Dip the salmon fillet into the egg, then press the couscous mixture onto the salmon fillet to coat.
Heat the vegetable oil in an oven-proof, non-stick frying pan. Add the couscous-coated salmon and pan fry for 1-2 minutes, turning once, until golden brown on each side.
Transfer to the oven and bake for 4-5 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked.
