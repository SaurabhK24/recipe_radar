Ingredients:
1 lemon, juice only
3 king prawns, peeled and de-veined
1 tbsp tomato ketchup
¼ tsp Tabasco sauce
2 tbsp Greek yoghurt
½ lime, juice only
½ avocado, stone removed
1 sprig fresh dill, to garnish

Instructions:
Fill a small saucepan with water and bring it to a simmer.
Add half of the lemon juice and the three king prawns and reduce to a low simmer.
Poach the prawns for three minutes or until cooked all the way through. Remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool.
In a small bowl, mix the remaining lemon juice, tomato ketchup, Tabasco sauce, Greek yoghurt and lime juice until well combined.
When the prawns are cool, drain them and chop roughly. Stir the chopped prawns into the yoghurt mixture.
Spoon the prawn and yoghurt mixture into the cavity of the avocado.
Serve straightaway, garnished with fresh dill.
