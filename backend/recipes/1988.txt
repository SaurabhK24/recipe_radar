Ingredients:
2 Arbroath smokies, firm, but moist (Arbroath smokies are hot smoked small haddock)
1 bunch flat parsley, chopped
1 bunch dill, chopped
1 bunch spring onions, green parts only, chopped
400g/14oz risotto rice (carnaroli or arborio)
½ onion, finely chopped
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 glass dry white wine (such as, Orvieto Classico Superiore)
400ml/14fl oz light fish stock
400ml/14fl oz vegetable stock
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 lemon, juice only
100g/3½oz parmesan, finely grated
125g/4oz unsalted butter

Instructions:
Rub the smokies with a little oil and cook in a hot oven for 8-10 minutes.
Allow to cool, peel the skin off and flake the fish into a bowl. Set to one side.
In a thick-bottomed pan sweat the chopped onion in half of the olive oil until translucent, pour in the rice and fry until you start to hear it pop.
Pour on the white wine and stir continuously until the wine has been absorbed. Have the stocks boiling and at the ready and add to the pan. Stir occasionally and cook for 10-12 minutes.
The rice should be suspended in a thick sauce with a little bite. Beat in the butter and the spring onions.
Add the parmesan, beating all the time. Now add the fish and herbs.
Season with lemon juice, salt and pepper. Place into four large warmed bowls and drizzle with olive oil.
