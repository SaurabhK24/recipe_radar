Author: Gino D'Acampo

Ingredients:

For the Italian-style roast potatoes

1 tbsp olive oil
1 baking potato, peeled and chopped into chunks
2 sprigs fresh rosemary, chopped roughly
4 garlic cloves, crushed roughly with the flat side of a large knife
1 tsp sea salt

For the spiced sausages

1 tbsp olive oil
2 pork sausages
1 tsp dried chilli flakes
To serve

pinch cayenne pepper
1 small sprig fresh rosemary

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
For the potatoes, heat the olive oil in an ovenproof frying pan and fry the potatoes for 8-10 minutes, or until they start to colour. Add the rosemary, garlic cloves and salt. Place the pan in the oven and roast until the potatoes are cooked through, about 8-10 minutes.
For the sausages, heat the olive oil in a frying pan and add the sausages. Add the chilli flakes and cook over a medium heat, turning often, for about 10-15 minutes, or until completely cooked through.
To serve, place the sausages on one side of a serving plate and the rosemary potatoes on the other. Sprinkle with cayenne pepper and garnish with a sprig of fresh rosemary.
