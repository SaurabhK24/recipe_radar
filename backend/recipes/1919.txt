Ingredients:
lemon juice, to taste
malt vinegar, to taste
20 x raw tiger prawns, shells on
1 Little Gem lettuce
1 sprig fresh thyme, leaves picked
cayenne pepper, to serve

For the sauce

½ lemon, juice only
1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
5 tbsp tomato ketchup
few drops Tabasco sauce
2 pinches smoked paprika
½ tsp paprika
1 tbsp double cream
4 tbsp mayonnaise
1 pinch cayenne pepper
pinch salt
1 tsp cracked black pepper

Instructions:
Bring a large pan of water to the boil and add a squeeze of lemon and glug of vinegar. Add the whole prawns and cook until they rise to the surface. Drain and chill in ice-cold water.
Peel the cooled prawns, leaving one prawn whole per serving (for the garnish).
Cut the little Little Gem lettuce in half and place in ice-cold water to crisp it up.
For the sauce, mix all the sauce ingredients together.
To assemble the cocktails, drain the lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper. Arrange two-thirds of the leaves in martini glasses or small bowls.
Shred the remaining leaves and add to a mixing bowl. Add the peeled prawns and spoonful of sauce. Top with the unpeeled prawn and a sprinkling of cayenne pepper.
