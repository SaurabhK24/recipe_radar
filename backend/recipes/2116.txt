For the avocados

2 ripe avocados, peeled, stoned and cut into quarters
20g/1oz dried breadcrumbs
5g/¼oz plain flour

For the crab

fresh white crab meat (allow 40g/2oz per person)
2 spring onions, finely chopped
½ bunch chives
½ fresh lemon, juiced

For the chilli mint dressing

2 large mild red chillies, de-seeded and finely chopped
2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped
½ bunch mint
extra virgin olive oil
2 limes, juiced
2 tomatoes, blanched, peeled, and the flesh cut into small dice
sea salt, to taste

Instructions:
Combine all the ingredients for the chilli mint dressing one hour before required and set aside.
Prepare the salad leaves as desired and season lightly with salt and pepper before adding the olive oil and fresh lemon juice. Place equal amounts on each plate.
Dip the quarters of avocado in the flour, shake off any excess, then dip them in the beaten egg, rub gently with a finger to remove any excess and make sure the egg has completely coated the flour. Finally dip them in the breadcrumbs, again ensuring the avocado is completely covered.
Deep-fry the avocado quarters at 180C/350F until they are golden brown - around one minute. Remove, place on kitchen paper and season with salt and pepper.
Combine all the ingredients for the crab and place equal amounts on each plate.
Dress the avocados with the chilli mint dressing and place two quarters on each plate.
