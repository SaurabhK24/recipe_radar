Ingredients:

For the saltfish fritters

150g/5¼oz self-raising flour
1 free-range egg
50ml/1¾fl oz milk
salt and freshly ground black pepper
600ml/21¼fl oz vegetable oil, for frying
100g/3½oz smoked haddock

For the matchstick chips

1 potato
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp paprika

For the tomato relish

2 tomatoes, finely chopped
50ml/1¾fl oz olive oil
½ lime, juice only
2 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped
2 tbsp fresh basil, chopped
1 tsp chilli flakes

Instructions:
To make the saltfish fritters, in a medium bowl, start by adding the flour, add in the egg and whisk. Then add in the milk (add a little more if required). Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
In a medium sized saucepan, add the oil and make sure it's very hot. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be very dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)
Coat the fish in the batter and deep-fry until it is golden, for roughly 2-3 minutes.
Drain on kitchen paper.
To make the chips, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
Cut the potato into thin matchsticks and place on a baking tray.
Sprinkle with oil and paprika and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Place into the preheated oven for 15 minutes until golden and crisp.
To make the tomato relish, mix in a small bowl the tomatoes with the olive oil, the lime juice, the fresh herbs and the chilli flakes. Leave to stand for five minutes.
To serve, place the tomato relish at the bottom of the dish. Place the potato matchsticks and the fish on top and serve.
