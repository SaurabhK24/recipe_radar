Ingredients:

For the pâté

150g/5½oz chicken livers, trimmed
50ml/2fl oz double cream
2 whole free-range eggs
1 tsp port
salt and freshly ground black pepper
To serve

1 tsp fresh chives, chopped
4 slices ciabatta, toasted

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
For the pâté, place all of the ingredients into a food processor and pulse until smooth.
Transfer the mixture into two greased ramekins or dariole moulds and place into a roasting tin filled with enough water to reach half way up the sides of the moulds when they are placed in the tin. (This is called a bain-marie.) Place into the oven to cook for 15 minutes, or until completely cooked through.
To serve, turn out the pâté from the moulds onto plates, sprinkle with the chives and serve with the toasted ciabatta.
