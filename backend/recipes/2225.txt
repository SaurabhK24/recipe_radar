Ingredients:

For the sauce

1 tbsp butter
½ shallot, finely chopped
1 new potato, chopped
¼ fennel bulb, finely sliced
2 tbsp white wine
¼ tsp curry powder
2 tbsp double cream

For the scallops

1 tbsp butter
2 scallops, trimmed, shells removed; one shell reserved and cleaned
sprig fresh dill, to garnish

Instructions:
For the sauce, heat the butter in a pan and gently fry the shallot until softened but not coloured.
Add the new potato and fennel and fry for 2-3 minutes.
Add the wine and boil until the liquid is reduced by half.
Add the curry powder and cream and simmer for 3-4 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and set aside in a warm place.
For the scallops, heat the butter in a separate pan. Fry the scallops for one minute on each side, or until cooked to your liking.
To serve, place the scallops into the reserved shell, pour over the sauce and garnish with dill.
