Ingredients:
300ml/Â½ pint vegetable oil, for deep frying
5 asparagus tips, steamed until tender, chopped
4 slices smoked duck breast, chopped
2 tbsp ready-made plum sauce
2 sheets filo pastry
1 free-range egg, beaten
1 tbsp sesame seeds, to serve

Instructions:
Place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed pan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)
Place the chopped asparagus, duck and plum sauce into a small bowl and mix well.
Lay one sheet of filo pastry on a board and brush with beaten egg. Lay the remaining sheet of pastry on top to make a double layer. Cut the pastry into four long strips and place a spoonful of the filling mixture at one end of each strip. Brush the edges of the pastry with egg, then fold up along the length of the strip to make triangle shapes. Brush each triangle with more beaten egg.
Carefully place the spring rolls into the hot oil and deep fry for 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.
To serve, place the spring rolls onto a serving plate and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
