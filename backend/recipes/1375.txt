Ingredients:
500g/1lb 2oz soft butter
2 tbsp rapeseed oil
50g/2oz Parma ham, finely chopped
100g/3½oz button mushrooms, finely chopped
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
100g/3½oz shallots, finely chopped
100g/3½oz fennel, finely chopped
1 tbsp finely chopped fresh parsley
1 tbsp finely chopped fresh tarragon
1 tbsp Pommery mustard
1 tbsp dried breadcrumbs
1 cooked lobster coral
2 tbsp ground almonds
2 whole cooked lobster

For the samphire

50g/2oz butter
200g/7oz samphire

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
Place the butter into a food processor and blend until it is fluffy and white.
Heat a large frying pan and add the oil. Once hot add the Parma ham, button mushrooms, garlic, shallots, fennel and herbs and cook for 2-3 minutes. Allow to cool.
Add the cooled mixture to the blended butter along with the mustard, breadcrumbs, cooked lobster coral and ground almonds. Mix thoroughly and roll in cling film into a log shape and place in the fridge.
Blanch the lobster in salted water for 1½ minutes, then cut in half.
Remove the meat from the claws, knuckles and tails, reserving the body shells in tact. Place the meat back into the half-shell and onto a baking tray.
Unwrap the herb butter and slice into eight rounds. Place two slices of the butter on each half of lobster. Bake the lobsters in the oven for 4-5 minutes, until hot and bubbling.
Meanwhile, for the samphire, heat a medium frying pan and add the butter. Once melted add the samphire and cook for a couple of minutes.
