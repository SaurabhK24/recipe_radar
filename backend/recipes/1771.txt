Add in the beef fillet, stout, stock and thyme. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes.
Remove the beef fillet and set aside to rest, keeping warm.
Bring the stout mixture to the boil. Rub the butter and flour together until combined and add to the sauce, a little at a time, stirring until absorbed, to thicken the sauce.

Serve the beef with the cheesy, chive mash and spoon around the Guinness and shallot gravy.
