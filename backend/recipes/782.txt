Prep time: Less than 30 mins
Cook time: 10 to 30 mins
Serves: 2
Author: Gino D'Acampo

Ingredients:

For the risotto

55g/2oz butter
1 onion, finely chopped
½ courgette, chopped
225g/8oz risotto rice (such as arborio or canaroli)
425ml/¾ pint hot vegetable stock
30g/1oz freshly grated parmesan
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the griddled squid

1 tbsp olive oil
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
1 small squid, cleaned, lightly scored with a sharp knife
1 lemon, juice only
handful fresh parsley, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Heat the butter in a large pan and gently fry the onion until softened but not coloured.
Add the courgette and rice and stir well to coat the grains in oil.
Add the stock a little at a time, stirring well and ensuring all the stock has been absorbed before the next addition.
When all the stock has been absorbed and the rice is tender, stir in the cheese and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cover and set aside.
For the griddled squid, place the olive oil and garlic into a bowl. Place the squid into the bowl and stir well to coat it.
Heat a griddle pan until hot and cook the squid for 2-3 minutes, turning frequently, until chargrilled and cooked through but still tender (do not overcook or it will become tough). Drizzle over the lemon juice, sprinkle over the parsley and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To serve, place the risotto into bowls. Divide the squid into two pieces and top each portion of risotto with squid.
