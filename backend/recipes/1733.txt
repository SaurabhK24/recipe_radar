Ingredients:

For the peppered steak

150g/5½oz rump steak
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp whole peppercorns, crushed

For the carrots

1 carrot, peeled, roughly chopped and blanched
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the red onion relish

25g/1oz unsalted butter
1 tbsp olive oil
½ red onion, chopped
1 tbsp brown sugar
50ml/2fl oz red wine
1 tbsp red wine vinegar
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the mustard mash

25g/1oz unsalted butter
1 tbsp olive oil
50ml/2fl oz whole milk
1 tbsp wholegrain mustard
1 potato, peeled, cut into cubes and boiled until tender
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Preheat a non-stick baking sheet in the oven at 200C/400F/Gas 6.
For the steak, rub the steak all over with oil and press into the peppercorns to coat the steak.
Heat a griddle pan until very hot and chargrill the steak for 2-3 minutes on each side. Place the steak onto the preheated baking sheet.
Place the carrots onto the baking sheet with the steak, drizzle with oil, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and place into the oven to roast for 4-5 minutes. Remove the beef from the oven when cooked to your liking and leave to rest. Leave the carrots to continue roasting until beginning to turn golden-brown.
For the red onion relish, heat the butter and oil in a saucepan over a medium heat and cook the onion until softened but not coloured.
Add the brown sugar, stir well to coat the onions and cook until caramelised. Add the red wine and vinegar, bring to the boil and simmer until thickened. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
For the mustard mash, place the butter, oil, milk and mustard into a large bowl with the potato. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mash with a potato masher until smooth.
To serve, place the steak onto a plate with the carrots and mash and a spoonful of relish.
