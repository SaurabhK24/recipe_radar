Ingredients:

For the pork

2 x 350g/12oz pork loins or smoked pork loins, each cut in half
pinch ground cumin
salt and freshly ground black pepper
knob butter

For the figs and balsamic dressing

75g/3oz soft dark brown sugar
75g/3oz butter
125ml/4fl oz balsamic vinegar
6-8 figs, quartered
1 pomegranate, seeds only
Â½ orange, zest only
150g/5oz shelled unsalted pistachio nuts
To serve

roast potatoes, to serve
watercress, to serve

Instructions:
For the pork, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
Season the pork with the cumin and salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Melt a knob of butter in a large ovenproof pan over a medium heat. Brown the pork loins on all sides. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook the pork for about 12 minutes, until cooked through. The jucies will run clear when the pork is pierced with a skewer.
For the figs and balsamic dressing, heat the sugar and butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan until they begin to caramelise. Add the balsamic vinegar and stir to form a syrup. Take the pan off the heat and immediately add the figs, pomegranate seeds, orange zest and pistachio nuts, coating them all in the syrup. Set aside.
To serve, slice the pork and serve on watercress with the sauce spooned over with the hot roast potatoes.
