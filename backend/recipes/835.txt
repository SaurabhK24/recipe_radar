Ingredients:
2 free-range eggs
140g/5oz self-raising flour
50ml/2fl oz milk
butter, to grease
2 slices bacon, fried, grilled or baked until crisp.
1 tbsp honey, to serve

Instructions:
Whisk the eggs, flour and milk in a bowl until a smooth and thick batter is formed.
Grease a hot frying pan with the butter and add two portions of batter to the pan to create thick pancakes. When the surface appears to bubble, turn the pancakes over and cook the otherside for a further minute, or until golden.
Serve on a warm plate with the crispy bacon alongside and drizzle with honey.
