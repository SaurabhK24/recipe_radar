Ingredients:

For the blinis

85g/3oz buckwheat flour
1 tsp baking powder (gluten-free, if necessary)
salt and freshly ground black pepper
150ml/5fl oz full-fat milk
1 tsp mustard powder
70g/2Â½oz cheddar cheese, grated
small handful chopped fresh chives
2 free-range egg whites, preferably organic
pinch salt
knob of unsalted butter

For the scrambled eggs

4 free range or organic eggs (plus 2 free-range egg yolks)
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
knob of unsalted butter
To serve

2 tbsp chopped fresh chives
250g/9oz smoked salmon
1 lemon, cut into wedges

Instructions:
For the blinis, mix together the buckwheat flour, baking powder, a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper and the milk to make a smooth batter.
Add the mustard powder, cheddar and chives and mix until well combined.
In a seperate bowl, whisk the egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed.
Gradually fold the whisked egg whites into the batter mixture using a metal spoon.
Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium high heat, and spoon large tablespoons of the batter into the pan to make medium sized pancakes, about 10cm/4in in diameter.
Fry the blinis, in batches, for 2-3 minutes until small bubbles appear on the surface and the underside looks cooked. Turn the blinis over and cook on the other side for a further 1-2 minutes, or until golden-brown. Keep warm.
Repeat until all of the mixture is used up.
For the scrambled eggs, whisk the eggs in a bowl, and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Melt the butter in a small saucepan over a medium heat, then pour in the eggs, stirring a little to break the eggs up slightly as they set. Cook for 1-2 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat and set the eggs aside to finish cooking for a further 1-2 minutes.
To serve, place two blinis onto each of four serving plates, spoon on the scrambled eggs, and sprinkle over the chopped chives. Arrange the smoked salmon on the side, and finish with the lemon wedges.
