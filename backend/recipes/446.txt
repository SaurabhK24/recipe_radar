Ingredients:

For the buffalo slices

125g/4oz buffalo fillet, cut into 1cm/Â½in thick slices
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp olive oil

For the quick hollandaise sauce

2 free-range egg yolks
1 tsp white wine vinegar
1 lemon, zest and juice
1 tsp Dijon mustard
85g/3oz butter, melted
salt and freshly ground black pepper
To serve

2 rashers smoked bacon, cut into strips
small bunch fresh chervil, to garnish

Instructions:
For the buffalo slices, season the buffalo well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the buffalo for about two minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking.
For the quick hollandaise sauce, place the egg yolks, white wine vinegar, lemon zest and mustard into a jug. Gradually pour in the hot melted butter, blending the mixture as you go with a hand-blender until the sauce thickens and emulsifies. Stir in the juice of about half a lemon and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To serve, place the bacon strips into a pan and fry until crisp.
Place the buffalo slices onto a serving plate and top with the bacon. Drizzle over the hollandaise sauce and garnish with fresh chervil.
