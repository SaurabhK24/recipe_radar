Ingredients:

For the cabbage

1 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp chilli flakes
¼ savoy cabbage, finely sliced
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the steak

1 tbsp olive oil
200g/7oz rump steak
salt and freshly ground black pepper
½ tsp chilli flakes
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 tsp sesame seeds

For the herb oil

1 tbsp finely chopped fresh parsley
1 tbsp finely chopped fresh basil
½ tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
For the cabbage, heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the chilli and cabbage for 4-5 minutes, or until softened. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
For the steak, heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan. Season the steak on both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper and fry for 3-4 minutes on each side.
Sprinkle over the chilli flakes, garlic and sesame seeds and fry for a further two minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking. Remove from the heat and set aside to rest for five minutes, then slice into three pieces.
For the herb oil, mix the herbs with the oil in a bowl and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To serve, pile the cabbage onto a serving plate, top with the steak and drizzle over the herb oil.
