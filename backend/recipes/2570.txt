Ingredients:
150g/5½oz couscous
100g/3½oz rump steak
2 tbsp red wine
a little beef stock
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the roasted vegetables

1 tbsp olive oil
2 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
1/3 red pepper, cut in cubes
¼ onion, cut roughly
75g/3oz sprouting broccoli

Instructions:
Preheat two medium-sized frying pans.
Preheat the oven to a hot heat.
Place the couscous in a medium bowl. Pour over enough boiling water to cover the couscous and cling film bowl. Allow the couscous to steam for five minutes.
While the couscous is steaming, make the roasted vegetables. Drizzle the olive oil into the second frying pan. Add the vegetables and fry for two minutes.
Transfer the vegetables to the oven and roast for 5-8 mins.
While the vegetables are roasting, season the steak well and drop it into one of the frying pans. Fry for three minutes, either side.
Remove the steak and set aside. Add the red wine and a little beef stock. Stir to collect the steak juices.
Remove the roasted vegetables from the oven.
Place the steak on a plate and serve with a spoon of the roasted vegetables and couscous and a drizzle of the red wine sauce.
