Author: Simon Rimmer

Ingredients:

For the dauphinoise

1 head celeriac (about 400g/14oz), peeled and thinly sliced
butter, for greasing
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp finely chopped sage
100g/3½oz mature cheddar cheese, grated
150ml/5fl oz double cream
50ml/2fl oz full-fat milk
2 garlic cloves, crushed
salt and freshly ground pepper

For the pork

75g/2½oz butter
2 x 200g/7oz pork tenderloins
salt and freshly ground black pepper
To serve

fine beans
apple chutney

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
For the dauphinoise, grease an ovenproof dish with butter and place a layer of celeriac slices on the base.
Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and sprinkle over a pinch of sage and a little cheese. Repeat layers of celeriac, sage and cheese until all the celeriac is used, setting aside a third of the cheese.
Combine the cream, milk and garlic and pour over the celeriac.
Top with the remaining cheese (and if you have time, allow to sit for 30 minutes for the cream to soak into the celeriac).
Bake for an hour or until the vegetables are tender.
For the pork, heat the butter in a pan, season the pork with salt and freshly ground black pepper and slice into 2.5cm/1in slices. Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side. Remove from the pan and keep warm until you are ready to serve.
To serve, cut out a round of the dauphinoise with a biscuit cutter and serve with the pork, fine green beans and apple chutney
