Ingredients:
3 corn fed chicken breasts, skin removed
100g/3½oz chicken livers
180g/6oz pork belly, minced
1 tsp salt
2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1 unwaxed lemon, zest only
2 shallots, finely sliced
2 sprigs lemon thyme, leaves picked
50g/1¾oz pistachios, blanched
20 thin slices streaky bacon

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
Cut each chicken breast into three big slices and set aside.
Mix the chicken livers into the minced pork and season with the salt and pepper. Add the lemon zest, shallots, thyme leaves and pistachios.
Line a terrine mould or loaf tin with the bacon, leaving enough overhanging to cover the top when filled. Press in the mince and chicken pieces and cover completely with the bacon.
Place the mould in a roasting tin filled with enough water to reach half way up the side of the mould.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour 15 minutes.
Allow to cool for 24 hours in the fridge then slice. Serve with pickled onions or gherkins, toast and salad leaves.
