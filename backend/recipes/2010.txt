Author: Ross Burden

Ingredients:

For the duck

1 tbsp olive oil
1 duck breast, skin scored
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the rösti

1 sweet potato, peeled and grated
2 tbsp cornflour
salt and freshly ground black pepper
25g/1oz unsalted butter

For the red wine sauce

2 tbsp duck fat
100ml/3½fl oz red wine
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
Heat the olive oil in an ovenproof frying pan and place the duck breast skin-side down into the pan. Cook for three minutes, or until the skin is crisp and golden.
Turn the duck breast over and place the pan in the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until completely cooked through. Remove and rest for one minute, then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
For the rösti, mix the grated potato and cornflour in a bowl, then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Melt the butter in an ovenproof blini pan and add the potato mixture into the bottom of the buttered pan, pressing down to make an even surface. Fry for two minutes, or until golden, then turn the rösti over in the pan. Fry for a further two minutes, and place in the oven and cook for five minutes, or until cooked through.
For the sauce, heat the duck fat in a frying pan. Add the red wine, bring to the boil, and reduce until thickened.
To serve, place the duck on top of the rösti on a large plate, then spoon over the sauce.
