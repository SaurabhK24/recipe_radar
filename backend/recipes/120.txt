Author: Brian Turner

Ingredients:
1 tbsp sunflower oil
1 tsp clear honey
pinch ground turmeric
½ tsp medium curry powder
4 mini chicken fillets, or two small skinless chicken breasts cut into strips
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the dip

4 tbsp canned coconut milk
1 tbsp double cream
¼ ripe mango, peeled, stone removed and flesh chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Heat a griddle pan until very hot. Soak two bamboo skewers in water for 10 minutes.
Place the oil, honey, turmeric and curry powder into a bowl and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Mix well.
Dip the chicken pieces into the honey and spice mixture to completely coat.
Thread the chicken pieces onto the bamboo skewers, then place onto the griddle pan. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until completely cooked through.
Meanwhile, for the dip, place the coconut milk, cream and mango into a mini-food processor and blend to a smooth sauce.
Pour the dip into a small pan over a low heat and cook gently for 2-3 minutes, until just heated through but not boiling.
To serve, arrange the chicken skewers on a warmed plate and set a small dish of the mango and coconut dip alongside.
