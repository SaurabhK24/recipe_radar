Ingredients:

For the crusted pistachio chicken

1 chicken breast, cut in half to make 2 thin escalopes
dash olive oil
55g/2oz pistachios, shells removed, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the pea mash

150g/5½oz frozen peas, defrosted
25g/1oz butter
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the fennel salad and herb vinaigrette

½ fennel bulb, finely sliced
¼ red pepper, finely sliced
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
3 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley

Instructions:
For the crusted pistachio chicken, rub the chicken in olive oil, roll in the chopped pistachios and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Drizzle with a little more olive oil, heat a griddle pan and griddle the chicken for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until completely cooked through.
For the pea mash, cook the peas in a pan of boiling salted water for 2-3 minutes. Drain and return to the pan with the butter, salt and freshly ground black pepper. Process with a hand blender until smooth, adding a little water if the mixture is too thick.
For the fennel salad, place all the salad ingredients into a large bowl and stir well.
To serve, place the pea mash onto a serving plate, top with the spiced chicken and place the salad on the side.
