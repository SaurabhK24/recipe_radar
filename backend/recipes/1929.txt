Ingredients:

For the stuffed chicken breast

1 chicken breast, butterflied
6 black olives, pits removed, chopped
1 vine tomato, de-seeded and chopped
6 fresh basil leaves, torn
salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 slices prosciutto
1 tbsp olive oil

For the tomato sauce

2 tbsp tomato purée
2 tbsp water

For the parsley purée

1 handful fresh parsley leaves
2 tbsp olive oil

Instructions:
For the stuffed chicken breast, lay the prosciutto slices side-by-side, slightly overlapping, on a chopping board and place the butterflied chicken breast on top. Pile into the centre of the breast the olives, tomato and basil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fold the breast over, then roll up tightly in the prosciutto.
Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and cook the chicken breast for 4-5 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown all over and completely cooked through. Remove from the heat and allow to rest.
For the tomato sauce, place the tomato purée and water in a pan and heat through, stirring well.
For the parsley purée, place the parsley and oil together in a mini food processor and blend until smooth.
To serve, slice the chicken breast on the diagonal. Spoon a dollop of the tomato sauce in the centre of a serving plate and place the slices of chicken breast on top, then drizzle over the parsley purée and serve.
