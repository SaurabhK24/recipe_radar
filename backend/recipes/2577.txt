Ingredients:
500g/1lb 2oz live mussels
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 shallots, finely chopped
glass dry white wine
large handful chopped parsley
olive oil

Instructions:
Remove the beards from the mussels and give them a light clean under running water. Add the olive oil to a pan and put in the garlic and shallots, fry gently to soften but not colour then add the wine and bring to the boil, continue to boil for 2 minutes to take out some the alcohol.
Add half of the parsley and the mussels, cover and allow the shells to steam open, this will take around 3-4 minutes, discard any that don't open.
