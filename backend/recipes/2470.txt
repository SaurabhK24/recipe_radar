Ingredients:

For the spiced chicken

1 chicken breast
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp curry powder

For the sautéed leeks

1 tbsp olive oil
¼ leek, finely sliced

For the fondant potato

1 tbsp olive oil
1 small potato, peeled, cut into 1cm/½in thick slices, blanched until tender and dried

For the creamed carrot sauce

75ml/2½fl oz double cream
1 carrot, peeled, finely chopped and blanched
2 tsp caster sugar
dash white wine
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
For the spiced chicken, rub the chicken breast with the olive oil and curry powder.
Heat an ovenproof griddle pan and griddle the chicken on both sides until slightly browned. Transfer to the oven and bake until the chicken is completely cooked through.
For the sautéed leeks, heat the olive oil in a small frying pan, add the leeks and sauté for 4-5 minutes, or until soft and turning golden-brown. Remove the leeks from the pan and keep warm.
For the fondant potato, in the same frying pan heat the olive oil and fry the potato slices, turning frequently, until golden-brown on both sides.
For the creamed carrot sauce, place the cream, half of the carrot pieces, the sugar and white wine into a small pan and bring to the boil. Boil for five minutes, then remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.
Pour the carrot sauce mixture into a food processor, season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and blend until smooth.
To serve, place the sautéed leeks onto a serving plate and top with the fondant potato and the spiced chicken. Pour over the creamed carrot sauce and garnish with the remaining carrot pieces.
