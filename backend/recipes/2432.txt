Ingredients:
600g/1lb 5oz spaghetti
250g/8¾oz minced beef
1 egg
100g/3½oz "00" or strong flour
600g/1lb 5oz tinned, chopped tomatoes
1 medium onion, finely sliced
1 red chilli, finely sliced
small glass of red wine
90ml/3¼fl oz olive oil
handful of flatleaf parsley, finely chopped
100g/3½oz pecorino cheese
salt to taste

Instructions:
In a large bowl, mix the minced beef, egg and parsley together. Season to taste.
Now take a teaspoon of mixture and, in your hand, roll it into a ball. Dust the ball in flour and put to one side. Repeat with the rest of the mixture.
In a frying pan, gently sauté the onions and chilli in the olive oil until soft.
Add the meatballs and gently fry until golden brown.
Now add the red wine and simmer for approximately two minutes. Once the wine has evaporated, pour in the chopped tomatoes. Season to taste and cook for a further four minutes.
In the meantime, cook the pasta in boiling, salted water until al dente. Drain and add to the sauce.
Mix well and serve with freshly grated pecorino.
