Ingredients:

For the chutney

1 tbsp olive oil
2 garlic cloves
1 onion, roughly chopped
6 allspice berries
1 tsp curry powder
150g/6oz caster sugar
150ml/0.25pt white wine vinegar
454g/1lb quince, peeled, cored and roughly chopped
454g/1lb pears, peeled, cored and roughly chopped
454g/1lb tomatoes, blanched, peeled, deseeded and roughly chopped
1 tbsp each of roughly chopped coriander and parsley

For the scallops

20 medium scallops, cleaned
10 strips pancetta, halved widthways
4 rosemary stems, leaves removed, leaving a tuft at the top
2 tbsp olive oil

Instructions:
Heat the oil in a large pan and gently saut√© the garlic and onion for 2-3 minutes until softened. Stir the allspice and curry powder through and toast for 1 minute. Add the sugar and gently heat until caramelised. Deglaze the pan with the white wine vinegar and reduce for 1-2 minutes. Add the prepared quince and pear and cook down gently for 6-8 minutes until softened but still chunky. Leave to cool and then stir the tomatoes and herbs through gently. Season to taste.
In the meantime, prepare the scallops. Wrap a piece of panchetta around each of the scallops and skewer five onto each rosemary stick securely. Drizzle the oil over and griddle in a heated pan for 2-3 minutes each side until cooked through.
To serve, spoon the chutney down the centre of each serving plate and sit the scollop skewer on top.
