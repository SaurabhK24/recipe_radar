Ingredients:
8 mini chicken fillets
1 tbsp finely crushed black peppercorns
1 tbsp olive oil
4 rashers back bacon
1 avocado, roughly chopped
½ red onion, finely chopped
½ lemon, juice only
1 red chilli, finely chopped
½ tsp ground cumin
2 tbsp roughly chopped fresh coriander
salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 slices soy and linseed bread
2 tbsp ready-made mayonnaise
1 ball buffalo mozzarella, thickly sliced
To serve

4 cooked beetroot or 2 fresh tomatoes, sliced

Instructions:
Flatten the mini breast fillets with a meat mallet or rolling pin, until ½cm thick.
Sprinkle the chicken with crushed peppercorns to lightly coat.
Heat a frying pan until hot, then add the oil and the chicken. Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, until tender golden and completely cooked through.
Heat a second frying pan until hot, then add the bacon and fry until golden.
Meanwhile, place the avocado into a bowl and mash with a fork.
Add the red onion, lemon, chilli, cumin and coriander, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix well.
To assemble the sandwiches, spread the mayonnaise onto two slices of the bread. Top with the bacon, then the chicken, then the mozzarella slices. Spread the guacamole onto two more slices of the bread. Top each sandwich with lots of tomato or beetroot slices and close with the slice of guacamole-covered bread.
