Ingredients:
300g/10½oz pork fillet (tenderloin)

For the herb crust

1 tbsp fresh thyme, finely chopped
1 tbsp fresh rosemary, finely chopped
1 tbsp fresh oregano, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp honey

For the lentils

50g/2oz butter
1 red onion, finely chopped
1 eating apple, peeled and finely chopped
100g/3½oz Puy lentils, freshly cooked
150ml/5fl oz farmhouse cider
1 tbsp honey
1 tbsp wholegrain mustard
1 tbsp flatleaf parsley
25g/1oz butter
200g/7oz creamy, well-seasoned mashed potato, to serve

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 200C/390F/Gas 6.
To make the herb crust, mix together the herbs, garlic, olive oil and honey. Roll the pork fillet in the mixture to coat well.
Heat a pan until it's red-hot. Add the herb-crusted pork and sear for one minute on each side. Transfer to the oven and cook for a further ten minutes. Remove the pork and leave to rest for at least five minutes before serving.
In a clean pan, heat the butter until it foams. Add the onion and apple and cook them together for two minutes. Add the lentils and cider, and give them a few seconds of cooking time before you add the honey and mustard. Let the lentils warm for 2-3 minutes, then season and add the parsley. The idea is to leave enough 'cidery' liquid in the lentils to provide a sauce.
At the last minute, stir in the butter to thicken the sauce.
Carve the pork into 1cm (0.5in) thick chunks. Lay the pork slices onto the mash and spoon the lentils and liquor all around.
