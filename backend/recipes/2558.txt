Ingredients:

For the chips

vegetable oil, for deep-frying
1 potato, peeled and cut into thick chips

For the steak and egg

2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 rump steak
1 free-range egg

Instructions:
Heat a heavy bottomed saucepan, one-third full of vegetable oil, until a breadcrumb sizzles in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous! Do not leave unattended.)
Add the potato chips and deep-fry for 8-10 minutes, until crisp and golden. Carefully remove using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towels.
For the steak, place the steak in between two sheets of cling film. Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, bash to flatten.
Heat the oil in a non stick-frying pan. Add the steak and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, for medium, or longer, according to personal taste. Remove the steak from the pan and allow to rest for a few minutes.
Using the same pan the steak was cooked in, crack the egg in and fry for 2 minutes, until the yolk is set.
To serve, pile the chips up onto a serving plate and serve the steak and fried egg alongside.
