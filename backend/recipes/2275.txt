Ingredients:

For the seared lamb

1 tbsp olive oil
150g/5Â½oz lamb fillet
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 cloves garlic in their skins, crushed

For the honey carrots

1 bunch baby carrots, trimmed and washed
1 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp honey
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the pesto dressing

85g/3oz pine nuts, toasted
1 large handful basil leaves
1 clove garlic, crushed
4 tbsp olive oil

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
For the seared lamb, rub the oil into the meat and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fry in an ovenproof frying pan along with the garlic cloves, until golden-brown all over. Transfer to the oven for 5-6 minutes (for rare), or until cooked to your liking. Remove from the oven to rest.
For the honey carrots, cook the carrots in boiling water for 4-5 minutes, then drain well. Heat the oil in a frying pan and add the carrots along with the honey. Gently braise the carrots over a medium heat and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
For the pesto, place all of the ingredients into a food processor and blend to a smooth paste, adding more oil if necessary.
To serve, arrange the honey carrots on a serving plate. Slice the lamb and place on top of the carrots. Drizzle the pesto around the edge of the plate.
