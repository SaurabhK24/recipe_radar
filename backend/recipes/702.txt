Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil
100g/3½oz sirloin steak
freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp honey
1 red chilli, finely sliced
½ lime, juice only
To serve

100g/3½oz rice noodles, cooked according to packet instructions

Instructions:
Rub the olive oil into the steak and season with the freshly ground black pepper.
Heat a frying pan over a high heat. Add the steak and fry for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking. Remove and set aside in a warm place to rest.
Add the soy sauce, honey, chilli and lime to the pan the steak was cooked in and mix thoroughly. Cook over a medium heat for 2-3 minutes until the sauce has reduced to a sticky glaze.
To serve, cut the steak in half. Place the cooked rice noodles onto a serving plate, arrange the slices of steak on top, and pour the juices from the pan all over.
