Ingredients

1 ripe avocado
2 medium free-range eggs
1 tomato, finely chopped
3 spring onions, finely sliced
1-2 pitta breads, toasted
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.


Slice the avocado in half lengthwise and twist to separate the halves. Chop a knife into the avocado stone (like an axe) and lever it out of the avocado. If the stone is small, you may need a teaspoon to scoop out a bit of a bigger hole. A tablespoon-size hole works best.


Scrunch up some tin foil to hold the avocado halves in place on a baking tray, or wedge them into a small tin so they don't move.


Crack one of the eggs into a small bowl, then carefully pour it into one half of the avocado and season with salt and pepper. Repeat with the other half, then bake for 12-15 minutes until the egg white is cooked through.


Serve with the tomato, spring onions and toasted pitta on the side.




Recipe Tips
Spice it up - squeeze or dribble a little chilli sauce into each half of the avocado.
