Ingredients
For the sausage roll

3 x 5cm/2in strips ready-made puff pastry
1 cooking chorizo sausage, skin removed
1 egg, beaten

For the marmalade

1 tbsp olive oil
½ red onion, thinly sliced
2 tbsp soft brown sugar
1 tbsp tomato purée
1 tbsp red wine vinegar




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Wrap the pastry strips around the chorizo and brush with the beaten egg. Place onto a baking sheet and place into the oven to bake for 10 minutes, or until the pastry is golden.


For the marmalade, place the oil in a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the onions and fry for three minutes to soften. Add the remaining ingredients and cook for 7-8 minutes, or until thickened.


To serve, slice the sausage roll into three pieces and place onto a plate with a tablespoonful of the marmalade alongside.
