These delicious little meat-free canapés can be prepared to the end of step four and baked at the last minute. If liked, omit the tomatoes and use 100g/3½oz of sliced roasted red peppers from a jar instead.

Ingredients

12 ready-made doughballs
a little soft butter
150g/5½oz tub soft goats’ cheese
1 tbsp red pesto
¼ tsp chopped thyme leaves
12 cherry tomatoes
salt and freshly ground black pepper
25g/1oz parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), finely grated




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Slice the doughballs in half and then cut a thin slice off of the rounded side so that both halves have a flat base to stand on. Butter the upper side and arrange on a baking tray lined with baking paper.


Mix the goats’ cheese, pesto and thyme together in a small bowl. Spread this onto the buttered side of the doughballs, making sure that it is spread up to the edges.


Slice the tomatoes into thick slices and put one slice on top of each doughball half. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and then sprinkle over the parmesan cheese.


Bake for 10 minutes, or until crisp and lightly golden-brown. Serve warm.
