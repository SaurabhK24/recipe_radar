Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
1 chicory, leaves separated
50g/2oz Dolcelatte cheese, crumbled
1 tbsp chives, chopped
1 orange, peeled, segmented
handful fresh parsley, chopped




Method


Preheat the grill to a medium heat.


Rub the chicory leaves with olive oil, heat a griddle pan until smoking hot, add the chicory and griddle for two minutes.


Place the griddled chicory onto a baking sheet, top with the Dolcelatte and place under the grill for two minutes, or until the cheese is beginning to melt.


To serve, sprinkle with chives and place the griddled chicory in the middle of a serving plate. Arrange the orange segments around the edge and garnish with the chopped parsley.
