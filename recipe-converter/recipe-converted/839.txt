1 tbsp groundnut oil
1 onion, peeled and sliced
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 red pepper, sliced
1 yellow pepper, sliced
100g/4oz broccoli florets
175g/6oz baby sweetcorn, halved
2 courgettes, sliced
50g/2oz water chestnuts, sliced
2 tbsp light soy sauce
1 tsp arrowroot, mixed with
2 tbsp light vegetable stock
5cm/2in piece fresh root ginger, grated and juice squeezed out
1 tbsp sweet chilli sauce
50g/2oz cashew nuts, lightly toasted




Method


Heat the oil in a wok and fry the onion and garlic for 3 minutes. Add the peppers and fry for 3 minutes more.


Add the broccoli florets, sweetcorn and courgettes and continue to fry for a further 5 minutes. Add the water chestnuts and toss to mix in.


In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, arrowroot and light stock, ginger juice and sweet chilli sauce.


Using a wooden spoon, make a space in the centre of the stir fried vegetables so that the base of the wok is visible. Pour in the sauce and bring to the boil, stirring all the time until it starts to thicken. Toss the vegetables to coat thoroughly with the sauce.


Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle with the cashew nuts.
