Ingredients

1 medium onion, diced
1 tsp chopped garlic
3 tbsp olive oil
1 aubergine, diced
1 courgette, diced
1 red pepper, diced
pinch chilli powder
2 tomatoes peeled, de-seeded and diced
1 tbsp fresh coriander leaves, chopped
¾ tsp saffron strands (soaked 1 tbsp warm water)
squeeze lemon juice
salt and coarsely ground black pepper




Method


Sprinkle aubergine with salt and set aside for 15 minutes before rinsing and patting dry with a cloth (to draw out any bitter juices).

Add the diced aubergine, the diced courgette, diced red pepper and chilli powder.


Stir and fry for 5-10 minutes until softened, season with salt and the coarsely ground black pepper.


Stir in the chopped tomatoes, heat through for five minutes.
