Ingredients
For the chilli colcannon

25g/1oz butter
100g/3½oz spring greens, shredded
½ tsp chilli flakes
freshly grated nutmeg, to taste
300g/10½oz mashed potato
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the deep-fried tomato rings

300ml/½ pint vegetable oil, for deep frying
½ beef tomato, cut into thick slices
100ml/3½fl oz milk
3 tbsp plain flour

To serve

2 Italian pork sausages, grilled
1 free-range egg, fried
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives




Method


For the chilli colcannon, heat the butter in a pan and stir fry the greens until they start to soften. Add the chilli flakes and nutmeg and stir.


Stir in the mashed potato and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fry until the mash is turning golden-brown, about 7-8 minutes.


For the tomato rings, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-based saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Soak the slices of tomato in the milk, then dredge with the flour. Place the tomatoes into the hot oil and deep fry until golden-brown and crisp, about 5-6 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


To serve, place the chilli colcannon onto a serving plate and top with the grilled sausages and fried egg. Place the tomato rings around the outside and sprinkle over the chopped chives.
