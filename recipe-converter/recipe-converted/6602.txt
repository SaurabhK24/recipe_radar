A really simple mushroom soup recipe - make it extra special by using wild mushrooms.






By James Tanner






Ingredients

50g/2oz butter
2 leeks, chopped
3 garlic cloves, chopped
300g/9 oz mushrooms, sliced
2 -3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only
600ml/1 pint chicken or vegetable stock




Method


Melt the butter in a large pot and gently cook the leeks and garlic for 4-5 minutes or until softened. Add the mushrooms and thyme and cook on high for 2-3 minutes.


Pour over the stock and cook for 5 minutes.


Remove from the heat, carefully pour into a food processor and blend until smooth. Alternatively, keep in the pot and use a stick blender to blitz until smooth.


Divide between four bowls and serve.
