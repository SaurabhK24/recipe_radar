Ingredients
For the chermoula paste:

2 Spanish onions
5 cloves garlic
1 lemon, juiced
1 bunch flat leaf parsley
1 bunch coriander
sea salt, to season
cumin powder, coriander powder, chilli powder and turmeric powder, to taste
½ cup extra virgin olive oil
olive oil, for cooking
1 whole chicken, chopped into sauté style pieces
1 Spanish onion, chopped into six
2 carrots, chopped into large pieces
1 small yam, chopped into large pieces
2 tbsp honey
small handful black olives
1 preserved lemon, finely chopped (see separate recipe)
water or stock
8 fresh dates, stones removed




Method


To make the chermoula, simply place all ingredients in a food processor and blend.


Marinate the chicken well in the paste.


Heat the olive oil in a heavy-based saucepan. Add the chicken pieces and sauté for a couple of minutes, colouring well on all sides.


Add the honey, vegetables, olives and preserved lemon and mix well.


Add enough stock or water to cover the chicken and vegetables liberally, and braise until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are soft. Stir in the dates.




Recipe Tips
Serve the tagine with couscous (note that couscous is not gluten-free).
