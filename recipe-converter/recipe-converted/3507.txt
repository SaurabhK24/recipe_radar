Ingredients
For the deep-fried tortillas

300ml/10½fl oz vegetable oil, for deep frying
2 ready-made flour tortillas, cut into triangles

For the red pepper sauce

3-4 roasted red peppers, from a jar
2 tbsp olive oil
4 tbsp Greek-style yoghurt




Method


For the deep-fried tortillas, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Carefully place the tortilla triangles into the hot oil and deep fry until golden.


Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


Pile into a large serving bowl.


For the red pepper sauce, place the red peppers and the olive oil in a small blender and blend until smooth. Stir in the Greek-style yoghurt.


Pour the sauce into a small bowl and serve with the tortillas.
