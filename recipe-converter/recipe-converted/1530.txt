1 carrot, peeled and grated
50g/1½oz brown sugar
50ml/2fl oz white wine

For the crumble topping

100g/3½oz plain flour

100g/3½oz brown sugar
2 tsp ground cinnamon
2 tbsp sesame seeds

Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the filling, melt the butter in a frying pan and cook the apple and carrot until soft.


Add the brown sugar and cook until caramelised.


Add the white wine and simmer until the mixture is thickened.


Lightly grease a small ovenproof dish and pour the mixture into the dish.


For the topping, place the flour and butter into a large bowl and rub together until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the brown sugar, cinnamon and sesame seeds and mix well.


Sprinkle the crumble topping over the filling and bake in the oven for 12-14 minutes, until golden-brown.
