Bara brith (literally “mottled bread”) is sometimes made with yeast but Mary’s family recipe omits it, giving a wonderfully sticky texture. It is best spread with plenty of butter.

Ingredients

450g/1lb dried mixed fruit
250g/9oz brown sugar
300ml/½ pint warm black tea
2 tsp mixed spice
450g/1lb self-raising flour
1 free-range egg, beaten




Method


In a large bowl soak the fruit and sugar in strained tea and leave overnight.


Next day preheat the oven to 170C/325F/Gas 3. Line a 900g/2lb loaf tin with baking parchment.


Mix the remaining ingredients into the fruit mixture and beat well.


Pour the mixture into the loaf tin and bake the oven and bake for 1½ hours or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.
