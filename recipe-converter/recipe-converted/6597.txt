Make this full-flavoured Italian classic using robust mushrooms such as Portobello, chestnut or wild mushrooms.

From A Taste of My Life






Ingredients

50g/2oz butter, plus a knob extra
3 shallots, chopped
1 garlic clove, chopped
350g/12oz Arborio rice
175ml/6fl oz white wine
600ml/1 pint 1½fl oz hot vegetable stock
150g/5oz mushrooms, chopped
30g/1oz freshly grated parmesan, or a similar vegetarian hard cheese
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Melt the butter in a pan over a medium heat. Add the shallots and garlic and fry until softened but not coloured.


Add the rice, stir well and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the rice is slightly translucent.


Add the white wine and stir well until the wine is almost completely absorbed.


Add a ladleful of stock and allow the rice to absorb this liquid, stirring constantly. Add further ladlefuls of stock, stirring and allowing the rice to absorb almost all of the stock before adding the each ladleful.


Once all the stock has been added and absorbed, add the mushrooms and stir well.


Once the rice is cooked, but slightly al dente, add an extra knob of butter and the parmesan and stir well.


Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then spoon into warmed dishes and serve immediately.
