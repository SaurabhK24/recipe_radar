Ingredients

4 free-range eggs, separated
100g/3½oz caster sugar
300ml/½pint double cream

Vanilla flavour

1 tsp vanilla extract

Ginger flavour

100g/3½oz stem ginger, chopped, plus 4 tbsp syrup from the jar

Coffee and brandy flavour

2-3 tbsp coffee essence
2 tbsp brandy

Raspberry flavour

150ml/5fl oz sieved raspberry purée (you could also use strawberry)

Rum and raisin flavour

100g/3½oz raisins soaked in 4 tbsp rum for 2 hours




Method


Whisk the egg whites in a large bowl until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed.


Slowly whisk in the caster sugar, then continue to whisk until the egg whites are stiff and glossy.


Whisk the cream in a separate bowl until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed.


Fold the cream, egg yolks and your chosen flavouring (see ingredients list) into the meringue mixture until well combined.


Pour into a plastic container and freeze for at least two hours.




Recipe Tips
I like to use this ice cream in my Knickerbocker glory. I make it in a classic tall Sundae glass, using three scoops of ice cream layered with crushed fresh pineapple, raspberry purée and whipped cream decorated with fresh raspberries of cherries.
