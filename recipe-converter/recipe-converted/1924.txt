Ingredients

50g/1¾oz Gouda cheese, grated
25g/1oz fresh white breadcrumbs
2 tbsp chopped fresh flatleaf parsley
salt and freshly ground black pepper
½ beef tomato, seeds removed

Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


In a bowl, mix together half of the cheese, the breadcrumbs and parsley and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Pile the mixture into the hollowed-out tomato. Top with the remaining cheese and drizzle with olive oil.


Place onto a baking tray and bake in the oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbling and starting to turn golden-brown. Serve.
