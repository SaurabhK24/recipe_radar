Ingredients

50g/2oz unsalted butter
100g/3½oz plain yoghurt
50g/2oz caster sugar
50g/2oz vanilla sugar
5cm/2in piece fresh root ginger, finely grated
2 eggs
40g/1½oz corn flour
65g/2½oz plain flour
1 tsp baking powder
150ml/5fl oz maple syrup
8 ripe but firm Victoria plums, stoned and cut into 1cm/½in pieces
crème fraîche, to serve




Method


In a bowl beat together the butter, yoghurt, both sugars and ginger until light and fluffy with a handmixer.


Beat in the eggs one by one. Sift together the flours and baking powder and fold into the mixture.


Take four large souffli or ramekin dishes, about 200ml/7fl oz in capacity, and divide the maple syrup between them. Top with the plums.


Spoon the ginger mixture over the plums, then cover the dishes with cling-film and place in a saucepan. Pour enough boiling water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the dishes, then cover the pan and simmer gently for 25-30 minutes until a knife inserted in the centre of the pudding comes out clean.


Remove the puddings carefully and allow to cool slightly for about 10 minutes before turning them out on to serving plates. Serve with vanilla ice cream or crème fraîche.
