Ingredients

1 tbsp vegetable oil
1kg/2lb 3oz lamb shoulder, cut into large cubes
1 large onion, roughly chopped
1 garlic clove
6 sticks celery, roughly chopped
3 carrots, roughly chopped
750ml/1 pint 7fl oz red wine
350ml/12½fl oz beef stock
salt
20 black peppercorns
200g/7oz mixed olives

For the cauliflower purée

1 cauliflower head, broken into large florets
100ml/3½fl oz chicken stock
200ml/7fl oz double cream
pinch curry powder
salt and freshly ground black pepper

To serve

fresh parsley, chopped




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/355F/Gas 4.


Heat the oil in a large casserole over a medium heat and fry the lamb pieces quickly to brown on all sides. Remove the meat from the pan and place in a clean bowl.


Reduce the heat slightly, and add the onion, garlic, celery and carrot to the casserole. Fry for 5-6 minutes, until the vegetables are softened.


Add the wine, stock and peppercorns and bring the mixture to the boil.


Return the meat to the pot and transfer to the oven to cook for two hours in the oven.


Meanwhile, to make the cauliflower purée, place the cauliflower into a large saucepan and pour over the chicken stock. Cover with a lid and bring to the boil. Cook for 7-8 minutes, or until the cauliflower is tender.


Place the cauliflower into a food processor and add the cream and curry powder. Blend to a smooth paste, then pass the mixture through a sieve.


Remove the casserole from the oven. Add the olives and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, spoon generous portions out onto plates. Sprinkle with parsley and place a spoonful of cauliflower purée alongside.
