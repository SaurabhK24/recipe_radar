Ingredients

½ tsp cornflour
2 tbsp milk
200ml/7¼ fl oz evaporated milk
200ml/7¼ fl oz condensed milk
200g/7¼oz thick double cream
seeds of 2-3 cardamom pods, crushed




Method


Mix the cornflour with the milk and set aside.


In a saucepan, heat the evaporated milk and bring to the boil.


Add the condensed milk, double cream, cardamom and the cornflour mixture.


Stir well for one minute.


Remove from the heat. Allow to cool slightly.


Place the creamy mixture in a food processor and blend for a couple of minutes to smooth out any lumps. I use a hand-held blender to whiz the mixture which works well.


Pour into a plastic container with a lid and freeze for at least six hours or overnight until the ice cream is quite firm.


The ice cream is quite rich so two small scoops for one person is ample.
