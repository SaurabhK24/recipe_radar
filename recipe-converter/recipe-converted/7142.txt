Ingredients

4 x 200g/7oz salmon steaks, on the bone
salt and freshly ground black pepper
9 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp butter
500g/1lb 2oz potato, peeled and cut into 1cm/Â½in cubes
4 tbsp capers, drained
200g/7oz Morecambe bay shrimps, peeled
2 tbsp white wine vinegar
4 tbsp chopped fresh flatleaf parsley
2 bunches fresh watercress, leaves only, to serve




Method


Season the salmon steaks with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Heat one tablespoon of the olive oil and all of the butter in a non-reactive frying pan, add the salmon steaks and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown, turning the salmon carefully. Set aside on a warm plate to rest. Reserve the pan and any juices.


Heat two tablespoons of the oil in a separate pan, add the potatoes and fry, stirring occasionally, until tender and golden-brown on all sides, about 15 minutes.


Meanwhile, add the capers and shrimps to the pan the salmon was cooked in and cook over a medium heat for 1-2 minutes.


Add the vinegar and the remaining olive oil and stir well to combine.


Add the chopped parsley and the fried potatoes and stir well to coat. Continue to cook for 1-2 minutes, then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, place a salmon steak into the centre of each of four serving plates. Place a portion of the watercress leaves at the horseshoe end of the salmon steak. Spoon a portion of the potato and shrimp mixture over each piece of salmon. Drizzle the pan juices around the edge of the plates.
