Ingredients

½ mango, stone removed, skin left on
2 tbsp caster sugar
½ tsp dried chilli flakes
1 lime, juiced

For the topping

4 tbsp Greek yoghurt
½ orange, zested

To garnish

icing sugar for dusting
1 tsp honey




Method


Preheat the grill to its highest setting.


Slice the mango flesh by cutting in a criss-cross pattern.


Turn the mango inside out to create a 'hedgehog' effect with the cut flesh.


Place the mango hedgehog on a baking sheet and sprinkle with the caster sugar, lime juice and dried chilli flakes.


Place the mango under the hot grill and cook for eight minutes, or until the sugar turns golden.


Meanwhile, for the topping, mix the Greek yoghurt with the orange zest in a bowl.


To serve, place the grilled mango on a plate with the yoghurt mixture. Dust with icing sugar and drizzle the honey around the plate.
