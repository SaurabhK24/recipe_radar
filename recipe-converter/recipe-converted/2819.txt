Coconut rice goes well with cooking from the Caribbean to southeast-Asia. It’s particularly good with any Thai green curry.

Ingredients

300g/10½oz rice
170ml/6fl oz coconut milk
170ml/6fl oz stock
salt, to taste
sugar, to taste
pepper, to taste




Method


Wash the rice well under cold running water to remove any excess starch and transfer to a saucepan which has a tight-fitting lid.


Mix the coconut milk and stock together and pour it over the washed rice.


Cover the saucepan with a lid and bring the rice to boil on high heat.


Once vigorously boiling, change to a low heat, cover with the lid and allow to simmer for 10 minutes, or until the water level is the same as the top of the rice.


At this point, turn the heat completely off and allow to rest for a further 10 minutes, keeping the lid on at all times. Use a wooden spoon to fluff up the rice before serving. Add salt, sugar and pepper to taste.
