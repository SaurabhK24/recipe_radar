3 tbsp clear honey
180g/6oz rolled oats
2-3 tbsp demerara sugar
240ml/8fl oz double cream

Method


Cook the apples in a very small amount of water until soft. Mash until smooth with the honey. Cool.


Toast the oats in a dry frying pan until golden. Cool and mix with the demerara sugar. Whip the cream until thick and fold in the yoghurt.


In a large glass dish or 6 individual ones, layer some of the apple with a sprinkling of the oats and then some of the cream mixture. Repeat these layers until all the mixture is used up, finishing with a layer of the cream mixture.


Chill before serving. Just before serving, sprinkle over a little more demerara sugar.
