An easy homemade versatile sauce that goes with pretty much anything.



Ingredients

50g/2oz basil
30g/1oz pine nuts, toasted
30g/1oz parmesan, or similar vegetarian hard cheese, freshly grated
1 clove garlic, crushed
85ml/3fl oz olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Put the basil, parmesan, garlic and pine nuts into a food processor and season well.


Whiz together and with the motor still running, pour the oil in until the pesto thickens.


Store in a clean jar in the fridge covered with a slick of oil to prevent it drying out.
