Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
2 flour tortillas
200g/7oz fillet steak
100g/3Â½oz mature cheddar, grated
2 spring onions, finely sliced
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan and fry the steak on both sides for about 1-2 minutes. Remove from the pan, slice thinly and set aside.


Place one flour tortilla into the pan. Layer up the cheese, spring onions, coriander and steak on top of the tortilla. Top with the other tortilla and sprinkle over a final layer of cheese.


Place the pan into the oven for about five minutes, until the cheese has begun to melt and the layers have stuck together.


Remove from the oven, cut into wedges and arrange on a serving plate.
