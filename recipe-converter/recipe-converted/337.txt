Ingredients

½ red chilli, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, chopped
½ onion, finely chopped
½ head broccoli, chopped into florets, stalk chopped into pieces
2 limes, juice only
150ml/¼ pint hot chicken stock
2 tsp soy sauce
55g/2oz salmon, cut into 2cm/1in cubes
55g/2oz medium egg noodles, cooked according to packet instructions and drained




Method


Place all the ingredients except the salmon and noodles into a pan, adding a little water, if necessary, to completely cover the ingredients. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 4-5 minutes.


Add the salmon to the broth and simmer for 3-4 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and the broccoli is tender. Add the noodles and stir to mix.


To serve, pour the broth into a bowl.
