This dessert is a Christmas compôte that's a cross between roasted fruit and mulled wine.





By Emily Angle






Ingredients

3 apples, peeled, cored and cut into eighths
3 pears, peeled, cored and quartered
5cm/2in orange peel, studded with 3 cloves
1 cinnamon stick
½ vanilla pod, split lengthways
1 tbsp sweetener, or 3 tbsp sugar
375ml/13fl oz (½ bottle) red wine, such as Rioja
250g/9oz frozen black cherries
50g/1¾oz raisins
low-fat crème fraîche, to serve (optional)




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.


Put everything into a shallow, ovenproof dish and bake for 45 minutes, stirring 2 or 3 times. The wine will slowly poach the fruit, leaving it intact and gloriously purple. Allow to cool slightly before serving with a dollop of low-fat crème fraîche, if using.
