125ml/4fl oz coconut milk, chilled

2 cardamom seeds (see tips)
7 ice cubes
1 tsp vanilla extract
tiny pinch sea salt
2 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
cacao nibs or sesame seeds, to garnish (optional)

Recipe Tips
Tip 1: If you have a strong juicer you could use raw beetroot instead of cooked.

  Tip 2: To get to the cardamom seeds, split the pod by crushing it with the flat blade of a knife and remove two seeds. Alternatively, use a pinch of ground cardamom.
