Ingredients
For the squid

vegetable oil, for deep-frying
110g/4oz plain flour
pinch of baking powder
enough sparkling water to make a batter
½ squid, cleaned and cut into strips

For the chutney

½ onion, peeled and chopped
110g/4oz cherry tomatoes, chopped
2 tbsp soft brown sugar
splash of balsamic vinegar
handful of coriander leaves




Method


Heat a pan one-third filled with vegetable oil for deep-frying, until a breadcrumb will sizzle gently in it. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be very dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Place the flour in a bowl with the baking powder and whisk in enough water to make a smooth batter, the consistency of double cream.


Dip the squid in the batter to coat.


Deep-fry in the hot oil for 3-4 minutes, or until crisp and golden. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain onto kitchen paper.


For the chutney, heat the onion, tomatoes, sugar, balsamic vinegar and coriander in a pan for 8-10 minutes, or until soften.


Transfer to a serving plate and serve the tempura squid alongside.
