1 garlic clove, halved
olive oil, for drizzling
2 tsp black peppercorns, crushed

For the wild mushroom sauce

1 tbsp olive oil
25g/1oz butter
½ onion, sliced
1 garlic clove, chopped
70g/2½oz mixed wild mushrooms, chopped

Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the peppered steak, rub the steak with the cut side of the garlic, rub with olive oil and roll in the peppercorns to coat all over.


Heat a frying pan and fry the steak for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking. Remove from the heat and leave to rest in a warm place.


For the wild mushroom sauce, heat the olive oil and butter in a pan, add the onion and sauté for 3-4 minutes.


Add the garlic and fry for one minute.


Add the mushrooms and cook for 3-4 minutes. Add the wine and simmer for 2-3 minutes, then stir in the cream and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


For the chips, place the sweet potato chips onto a baking sheet, drizzle with oil and sprinkle with sea salt.


Transfer to the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until crisp.


To serve, place the chips onto a serving plate, top with the steak and pour over the wild mushroom sauce. Garnish with parsley.
