Ingredients

300g/10½oz black glutinous rice (available from some Asian grocers), washed
170g/6oz palm sugar, grated
2 pandan leaves, shredded, or 2 drops pandan or vanilla essence (available from some Asian grocers)
450ml/15¾fl oz coconut milk
pinch of salt
fresh coconut, to garnish




Method


Soak the glutinous rice in water overnight.


Drain the rice, and place in a saucepan with 1.5 litres/2 pints 12¾oz of water. Heat the mixture until boiling and continue to cook for 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is tender.


Stir the sugar and one of the pandan leaves into the rice and continue to cook for another 5-7 minutes. Set aside to cool.


Meanwhile, heat the coconut milk, the remaining pandan leaf and the salt in a saucepan until the mixture thickens.


To serve, remove the pandan leaves from the rice and the coconut milk. Spoon the cooked black rice into each of 6 serving bowls. Pour over the coconut milk and garnish with the fresh coconut.
