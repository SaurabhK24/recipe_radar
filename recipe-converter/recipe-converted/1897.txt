Ingredients

2 tbsp olive oil
½ onion, peeled, chopped
4 baby aubergines, finely chopped
100g/3½oz tinned kidney beans, drained
150g/5½oz tinned cherry tomatoes
75g/2½oz kalamata olives, pitted, chopped
1 flour tortilla, warmed
50g/1¾oz cheddar cheese, grated




Method


Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onion and aubergine and gently fry for two minutes. Add the kidney beans, tomatoes and olives and cook for three minutes.


Lay a tortilla wrap out flat, fill with the kidney bean mix and roll up. Sprinkle with grated cheese and use a mini-blowtorch to "grill" the cheese until it has melted. (Alternatively, place the wrapped tortilla on a baking tray and place under a perheated grill, until the cheese has melted. Serve.
