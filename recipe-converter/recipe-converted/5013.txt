Ingredients
For the cheese crisp

30g/1oz Wensleydale cheese, grated

For the Quorn

2 tbsp soy sauce
2 tbsp clear honey
300g/10½oz Quorn 'chicken' pieces
dash olive oil
½ yellow pepper, sliced
1 tomato, chopped
small handful spinach
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the cheese crisp, sprinkle the grated cheese into a small non-stick frying pan and fry until melted and turning slightly crisp. Carefully remove from the pan and mould around a rolling pin to create a curled shape. Leave to cool.


For the Quorn, place the soy sauce, honey and Quorn into a small bowl, stir well and leave to marinate for ten minutes. Drain, reserving the marinating liquid.


Heat the olive oil in a wok and fry the Quorn for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown. Add the pepper and tomato and cook for 2-3 minutes, then add the marinating liquid and spinach. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook for a further 1-2 minutes, then spoon into a serving bowl.


To serve, top the glazed Quorn with the cheesy crisp.
