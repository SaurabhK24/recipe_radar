Ingredients

115g/4oz self-raising flour
4 tbsp Greek yoghurt
1-5 tbsp water
85g/3oz sultanas
pinch salt
1 tsp cracked black peppercorns
25g/1oz butter




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Place the flour into a large bowl. Mix the Greek yoghurt with one tablespoon of water and stir into the flour. Add more water to the flour, enough to make a soft dough.


Stir in the sultanas and a pinch of salt. On a clean, flat surface, roll out to 2.5cm/1in thick with a rolling pin and cut into small rectangles. Sprinkle with the cracked black peppercorns.


Melt the butter in an oven-proof griddle pan, add the flatbreads and cook for five minutes on one side. Flip over and then place the oven-proof pan into the oven and cook for a further five minutes, or until puffed up.


To serve, break into pieces.
