Ingredients

1 onion, peeled, very finely sliced
200g/7oz Maris Piper, or similar waxy potatoes, very finely sliced
50g/2oz butter
salt and freshly ground pepper
100g/3½oz smoked salmon, sliced
75g/2½oz mature cheddar cheese

For the dressing

100ml/3½fl oz yoghurt
1 lemon, zest and juice only
1 tbsp chopped fresh dill
salt and freshly ground black pepper

To serve

100g/3½oz smoked salmon slices




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/360F/Gas 4.


Melt half of the butter in a deep ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat. Add the sliced onion and fry until softened, then remove from the pan with a slotted spoon.


Place a layer of the potato slices into the same pan and fry for a few minutes until golden-brown.


Add a layer of the fried onion, then add another layer of the potato slices.


Continue to layer onion, potato, onion, until you are ready to add the final layer of potato.


Add a layer of smoked salmon and finish with a layer of potato.


Melt the remaining butter in a separate pan. Pour the melted butter over the layers of potatoes, salmon and onions.


Place the pan into the oven and bake for 40-45 minutes, or until cooked through. Towards the end of the cooking, preheat the grill to its highest setting.


Before serving, grate the cheese over the top and finish under the grill until the cheese is melted and golden-brown.


For the dressing, whisk together the yoghurt, lemon zest and juice and dill in a bowl. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, cut out wedges of the pan haggerty from the pan and place onto plates. Top with curled slices of smoked salmon and drizzle with the dressing.
