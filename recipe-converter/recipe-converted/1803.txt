Ingredients
For the salmon

½ tsp coriander seeds, crushed
½ tsp cumin seeds, crushed
salt and freshly ground black pepper
100g/3½oz salmon fillet, skin removed
1 tbsp olive oil

For the sauce vierge

1 tomato, skin and seeds removed, cut into small dice
½ lemon, juice only
½ lime, juice only
salt and freshly ground black pepper
½ tsp coriander seeds
handful fresh basil leaves, torn

To serve

handful cooked broccoli florets
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives




Method


For the salmon, combine the coriander and cumin seeds in a bowl with the salt and freshly ground black pepper. Press the salmon fillets into the mixture on both sides.


Heat the olive oil in a griddle pan and cook the salmon for 5-7 minutes or until cooked through, turning it over halfway through. (NB The salmon is cooked when the flesh is opaque.)


For the sauce vierge, heat all the ingredients gently in a pan for 1-2 minutes until warmed through.


To serve, put the spiced salmon onto a plate with the broccoli florets alongside. Drizzle the sauce vierge around the outside of the plate and garnish with the chopped chives.
