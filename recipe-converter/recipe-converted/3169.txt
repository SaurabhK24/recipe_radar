Ingredients
For the leeks

25g/1oz butter
1 leek, thinly sliced lengthways
85g/3oz feta cheese, crumbled
200ml/7fl oz double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the skewers

6 new potatoes, cooked and drained
½ red pepper, cut into chunks
2 sprigs fresh rosemary
2 tbsp olive oil




Method


For the leeks, melt the butter in a frying pan and gently fry the leeks for 4-5 minutes, or until softened. Stir in the cheese and cream and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Simmer for a further 4-5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.


For the skewers, soak two wooden skewers in cold water for ten minutes. Drain.


Thread the potatoes onto the skewers, alternating with the chunks of red pepper and rosemary. Brush with the oil and griddle in a hot chargrill pan for 4-5 minutes, turning occasionally, until the peppers are tender. Serve on top of the creamy leeks.
