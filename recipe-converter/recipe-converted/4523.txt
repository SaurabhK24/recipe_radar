From Mary Berry's Easter Feast






Ingredients

300g/10½oz fine green beans, trimmed and halved
200g/7oz baby broad beans
200g/7oz mangetout, halved lengthways
2 tbsp chopped fresh mint
coarse sea salt and black pepper

For the caper butter

30g/1oz butter
3 tbsp capers, kept whole
1 tbsp lemon juice




Method


Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the beans and broad beans for 3 minutes. Add the mangetout and cook for a further 2 minutes. Drain and tip into a warm bowl. Add half the mint, season with salt and pepper and toss.


Melt the butter in a saucepan over a high heat. Add the capers, lemon juice, blanched vegetables and remaining mint. Heating briefly and tossing together before serving. Serve piping hot.




Recipe Tips
Serve this straight after cooking otherwise the vegetables will lose their colour.
