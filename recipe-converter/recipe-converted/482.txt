Ingredients

350g/12oz cherry tomatoes
3 cloves garlic, peeled, sliced
1 tsp chilli flakes
150ml/5½fl oz extra virgin olive oil
125g/4½oz fresh breadcrumbs
100g/3½oz finely grated pecorino cheese
1 tsp chopped fresh thyme
salt and freshly ground black pepper
450g/1lb freshly-cooked penne pasta
1 tbsp torn fresh basil leaves
garlic bread, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/360F/Gas 4.


Place the tomatoes, garlic and chilli flakes into a baking dish and drizzle over the olive oil. Roast in the oven for 25 minutes, or until the tomatoes are softened.


Meanwhile in a bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs, pecorino cheese and thyme and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spoon the mixture over the tomatoes and place back into the oven for 4-5 minutes, or until the top is golden-brown and crisp.


Spoon the tomato mixture over the penne pasta in a bowl and mix well. Spoon the penne into serving bowls, then garnish with the torn basil and serve with garlic bread.
