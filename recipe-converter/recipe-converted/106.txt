Ingredients

500ml/18fl oz vegetable oil
3 flour tortillas, rolled up and sliced into strips
50g/2oz icing sugar, for dusting




Method


Heat the oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed pan. It is ready when a breadcrumb that is dropped in will sizzle gently in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Deep fry the tortilla strips for one minute until golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towel.


Serve in a large warm bowl and dust with icing sugar.
