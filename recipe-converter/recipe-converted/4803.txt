Ham, egg and chips is an underrated dinner - it might not be the healthiest meal but it sure is tasty.

Ingredients

75g/2½oz honey
50g/1¾oz soft light brown sugar
100ml/3½fl oz white wine vinegar
75g/2½oz black mustard seeds
75g/2½oz yellow mustard seeds
100ml/3½ fl oz beer
400g/14oz chipping potatoes, peeled and cut into batons
vegetable oil, for deep frying
4 free-range eggs
½ cooked ham hock, shredded
sea salt




Method


First make the mustard. Place the honey, sugar and vinegar in a saucepan and heat until the honey has dissolved.


Put the mustard seeds and beer in a bowl and pour over the warm honey mixture. Stir to combine and set aside in the fridge for two hours, or overnight.


Pour into a food processor and pulse to form a purée – it will take about five minutes for the seeds will break down and the mustard to become creamy.


You can store the mustard in the fridge in a sealed sterilised jar for up to two weeks.


To make the chips, heat a deep fat fryer to 160C/325F. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Place the potatoes into the fryer and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until light golden-brown and cooked through.


Drain the chips onto kitchen paper and sprinkle with sea salt.


While the chips are cooking, fry the eggs.Heat a frying pan until hot, add a little vegetable oil and crack the eggs directly onto the pan. Spoon the oil over the top of the eggs occasionally until just set and crisp around the edges. Add the ham to the pan as the eggs fry to heat through and crisp slightly.


To serve, pile the chips onto serving plates, place an egg alongside. Add some shredded ham hock next to it and finish with a dollop of mustard.
