Ingredients

55g/2oz dark chocolate, melted, cooled slightly
2 free-range eggs, separated
butter, softened, for greasing
cocoa powder, for dusting




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Place a baking sheet into the oven to warm up.


In a bowl, whisk together the melted chocolate and the egg yolks until well-combined.


Place the egg whites into a large bowl and whisk until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl. Carefully fold the egg whites into the chocolate mixture.


Butter a ramekin with the softened butter, then dust with cocoa powder and shake out the excess. Spoon the soufflé mix into the ramekin, level off and place on the hot baking sheet. Bake in the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until well risen.


Remove the soufflé from the oven and dust with cocoa powder, then serve immediately.
