Sweetcorn fritters are a nice alternative to other types of burger, and easy to jazz up with your own choice of sauces or spices. This is designed to be a low cost recipe.

Ingredients

500g/1lb 2oz frozen sweetcorn, defrosted
½ tsp chilli flakes
200g/7oz plain flour
1 tsp baking powder
2 eggs, beaten
150ml/5fl oz milk
salt and pepper
125g/4½oz bacon, chopped
2 tbsp olive oil
200g/7oz tomatoes, finely diced




Method


Put the sweetcorn and chilli flakes into a mixing bowl. Sift in the flour and baking powder and mix.


In a separate small bowl or jug, combine the eggs and milk and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Pour over the sweetcorn and flour, and mix well so that everything is evenly distributed.


Preheat the oven to 160C/325F/Gas 3.


Fry the bacon in a large dry frying pan over a medium heat until crisp and coloured. Once cooked remove and set to one side.


If there are any burnt bits in the frying pan remove these. Add some olive oil to the pan and then add tablespoon sized dollops of the sweetcorn batter to the pan (you will need to fry these in batches). Fry over a medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or until coloured, then turn and repeat on the other side. Keep warm in the preheated oven while you cook the remaining batter. Add a little more oil to the pan as you go to prevent the fritters sticking and to help them colour nicely.


Meanwhile season the finely diced tomato with salt and pepper.


Serve the crisp sweetcorn fritters with the bacon and the chopped tomato sprinkled over the top.
