Ingredients

2 eggs
110g/4oz plain flour
enough milk to bind
55g/2oz unsalted butter
4 tbsp cream cheese
85g/3oz caster sugar
1 orange, peeled and segmented
squeeze of lemon juice
1 miniature bottle brandy




Method


Beat the eggs and flour together in a bowl. Whisk in enough milk to make a smooth batter, the consistency of double cream.


Gently melt the butter in a non-stick frying pan or pancake pan. Ladle the batter in and swirl the pan to make a thin pancake. Cook for two minutes on each side, until golden. Repeat with the remaining batter to make more pancakes. Remove from the heat and spread with the cream cheese. Fold into quarters and place on a serving plate.


Meanwhile, heat the sugar in a pan until a caramel has formed. Add the orange segments, lemon juice and shake the pan to coat. Pour in the brandy to flambé and heat for another minute.


Pour the caramelised oranges over the pancakes to serve.
