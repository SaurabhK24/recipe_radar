Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
½ leek, cleaned and finely chopped
4 asparagus spears, chopped
150ml/5fl oz vegetable stock
100ml/3½fl oz double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper
crusty bread, to serve




Method


Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over a medium heat. Add the leek and asparagus and sauté for 2-3 minutes, to soften.


Add the vegetable stock, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to simmer gently for 8-10 minutes, until the asparagus is cooked through.


Transfer to a food processor, add the cream and blend until smooth.


Return the soup to the pan, season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and warm through gently.


To serve, pour into a soup bowl with the crusty bread placed on a plate alongside.
