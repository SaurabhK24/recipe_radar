Ingredients

6 mackerel fillets
½ lemon
10 juniper berries, lightly crushed
1 sprig thyme, leaves only
1 quantity sweet-sour marinade
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the marinade

400ml/14fl oz water
110g/4oz caster sugar
100ml/3½fl oz lemon juice
2 small licorice sticks, lightly crushed
4 star anise




Method


Pull out any pin bones from the mackerel using tweezers, cut the fillets into large diamonds and put them in a deep dish.


Cut the lemon half vertically through the middle, then slice it into thin semi-circles. Place these in between the mackerel diamonds, then scatter over the crushed juniper berries, salt, pepper and thyme.


Combine the water, sugar and lemon juice for the marinade in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Toss in the licorice sticks and star anise and simmer for 1 minute.


Pour the marinade over the mackerel diamonds while still hot. Cover with cling film and leave at room temperature until completely cold, then refrigerate for 2-3 hours depending on the size of the fish, a maximum of 2½ hours for small fillets, otherwise the consistency of the fish suffers.


Serve the mackerel straight from the dish, allowing everyone to season their own fish.
