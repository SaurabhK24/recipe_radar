Ingredients
For the mango

6x1cm/½in slices of mango
1 tbsp icing sugar

For the coconut custard

600ml/1 pint milk
200g/7oz creamed coconut
3 free-range egg yolks
2 tbsp caster sugar
1 lime, zest only




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


To prepare the mango, heat a griddle pan until smoking. Dust the mango slices with icing sugar and griddle for 2 minutes on each side.


To make the custard, pour the milk into a saucepan and add the creamed coconut. Allow the creamed coconut to melt. Scald the liquid and leave to cool for 1 minute.


In a large bowl, mix the yolks and sugar together. Gradually pour in the milk and coconut mixture, whisking continuously.


Return the mixture to the saucepan over a gentle heat. Stir continuously until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Remove from the heat and mix in the lime zest.


To serve, pour the custard into a warm bowl placed on a large plate and pile the mango to one side.
