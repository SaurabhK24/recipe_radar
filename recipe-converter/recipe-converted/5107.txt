Ingredients
For the cheese on toast

2 wholemeal pitta breads, split in half
100g/3½oz goats' cheese log, sliced
8 mixed red and yellow cherry tomatoes, halved
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 tbsp olive oil

For the herb paste

handful fresh parsley
large handful fresh basil, plus extra to garnish
1 garlic clove, crushed
4 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the cheese on toast, spread the pitta halves with the sliced goats' cheese and arrange the halved cherry tomatoes on top. Drizzle over the balsamic vinegar and olive oil and place on a baking tray. Bake in the oven for five minutes, or until the cheese starts to melt and turn golden-brown.


For the herb paste, place all of the herb paste ingredients into a small food processor and process until smooth.


Serve the cheese on toast with the herb paste spread over the top and scatter with basil, to garnish.
