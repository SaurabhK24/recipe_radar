Ingredients

40 large strawberries
250g/9oz good quality dark chocolate
40 long bamboo skewers
some oasis, soaked in water




Method


Trim the strawberries of any stalks.


Break the chocolate into bite-size pieces. Place in a bowl over a pan of gently simmering water. Allow the chocolate to melt and then remove from the heat, but leave the bowl over the warm water.


Place each strawberry onto a skewer and then dip the tip of each one into the melted chocolate. Twizzle each one to avoid any drips then place into the oasis. Repeat with each strawberry, leave them to cool and harden before serving.


These can be made in advance and kept in a cool dry place, but not in the fridge as they loose their sheen.
