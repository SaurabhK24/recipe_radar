Pitta breads make a quick base for these pizzas. Freeze the breads and the sauce in ice-cube trays so you can whip up a pizza in ten minutes.

Ingredients
For the tomato sauce

2 tbsp mlld olive oil or sunflower oil
½ onion, finely chopped
1 carrot, finely grated
1 red pepper, stalk removed, seeds removed, thinly sliced
2 garlic cloves, crushed
227g tin chopped tomatoes
2 tbsp tomato purée
1 tsp dried oregano
1 bay leaf
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the pizzas

12 white or wholemeal pitta breads
200g/7oz sliced ham, finely chopped
250g/9oz grated mozzarella




Method


Heat the oil in a large non-stick saucepan over a medium heat. Add the onion, carrot and pepper and fry for 4-5 minutes, stirring regularly, until softened. Add the garlic and fry for 1-2 minutes, stirring regularly.


Add the remaining tomato sauce ingredients and 100ml/3½fl oz water, stir well to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 18-20 minutes, stirring regularly, until the vegetables are very soft and most of the liquid has evaporated.


Remove the bay leaf, blend to a very smooth purée using a hand-held blender.


Preheat the grill to its hottest setting.


Place the pitta breads onto baking trays and spread some of the tomato sauce over each. Sprinkle over the ham and grated mozzarella. (At this point, the pizzas can be frozen on baking trays, then packed into freezer bags, ready for another day.)


Grill the pizzas for 2-3 minutes, or until the bread is piping hot and the cheese has melted and turned golden-brown. Serve immediately.




Recipe Tips
To cook from frozen, preheat the grill to a medium setting, then grill for 5-6 minutes, until piping hot throughout.
