Ingredients
For the fool

½ mango,stone removed, peeled and sliced
50ml/2fl oz whipping cream
100ml/4fl oz Greek yoghurt
25g/1oz icing sugar
sprig fresh mint

For the spun sugar

125g/4½oz caster sugar
cold water, to cover




Method


For the fool, line the bottom of a tall glass with half of the sliced mango.


Place the cream, yoghurt and icing sugar into a bowl and mix together well.


Spoon the cream mixture into the glass and top with the remaining mango.


For the spun sugar, place the sugar and enough water to cover into a saucepan and place over a high heat. Leave until the sugar has dissolved and the liquid has turned a light caramel colour. Remove from the heat and place the saucepan into a frying pan containing cold water.


Using a fork, carefully pull out sugar threads from the pan and shape around an oiled clean steel or other metal implement in a twisted pattern.


To serve, place the sugar threads on top of the pudding glass along with a sprig of mint.
