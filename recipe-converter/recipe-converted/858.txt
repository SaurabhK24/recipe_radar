Vegetarian toad in the hole makes a great meat-free mid-week meal.



Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
2 vegetarian sausages
3 level tbsp plain flour
1 small egg
6 tbsp whole milk
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 heaped tsp vegetable gravy granules, to serve
55g/2oz frozen peas, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 240C/220 Fan/Gas 9.


Heat the oil in a small frying pan and fry the sausages until browned on all sides, about 3-5 minutes.


Put the flour in a bowl, season with salt and pepper and make a well in the centre. Crack in the egg and pour in the milk, then whisk until combined and free of lumps.


Preheat a cupcake tray in the oven. When it is hot, drop the sausages into separate cupcake holes. Pour the batter around the sausages and bake for 15-18 minutes, or until golden-brown and risen.


Meanwhile, make the gravy and boil the peas according to the packet instructions. Serve immediately with the toad in the hole.
