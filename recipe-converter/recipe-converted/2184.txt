Ingredients

1 chicken breast
good handful of dried and soaked morels (retain the soaking juices)
1 shallot, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
2 knobs of butter
seasoned flour
½ glass white wine
1 shot glass cognac
double cream
salt and pepper
1 medium potato, peeled
handful of chopped sage




Method


Dust the pieces of chicken breast cut into strips with seasoned flour, then sauté for about 1 minute in butter until well browned. Remove the chicken from the pan and put into another frying pan with a knob of butter to keep cooking.


Meanwhile, in the previous pan, add the morels, shallots and garlic to the pan with a little butter and sauté for 30 seconds. Add a splash of white wine and cognac and flame off.


Then add the double cream and reduce the sauce. You can add some of the soaking juices if it is too thick.


For the mash, place the potato in a pan of cold water and simmer until cooked. Add the butter, cream and sage and mix well.


Put a dollop of simple rich mashed potato and sage in the centre of the plate and arrange the chicken around it. Pour over the sauce to serve.
