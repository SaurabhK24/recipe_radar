Ingredients

250g/½lb gram flour (chickpea flour)
50g/2oz self-raising flour
½ tsp red chilli powder
1 tsp garam masala
1 tsp tandoori masala powder (optional), available from specialist Asian supermarkets
1 tbsp lemon juice
300g/10½oz potatoes, peeled and cut into small pieces
300g/10½oz onions, finely chopped
3 spring onions, trimmed, finely chopped
6-8 spinach leaves, finely chopped
handful fresh coriander leaves
1 tsp chopped green chilli
1 tsp salt
sunflower oil, for deep frying




Method


Sift the gram flour and the self-raising flour into a bowl. Add the chilli powder, garam masala and tandoori masala powder, if using, and stir well to combine.


Add the lemon juice, then gradually add enough water to form a smooth batter that is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Set aside for 10-15 minutes.


Add all of the remaining ingredients except the sunflower oil to the batter mixture and mix well to coat the potatoes and onions.


Heat the oil in a deep heavy-based frying pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


When the oil is hot, carefully lower tablespoons of the batter mixture in batches into the oil and fry for 5-6 minutes, or until the pakoras are crisp and golden-brown and the vegetables have cooked through. Serve immediately.
