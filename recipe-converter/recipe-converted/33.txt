Ingredients:
1 sea bass fillet
1 lime
1/2 tsp caster sugar
1 tbsp vegetable oil
salt
pepper

Instructions:
Slice the sea bass fillet thinly on the diagonal using a very sharp knife.
Spread out the bass slices on a plate and sprinkle over the lime zest and juice, sugar and vegetable oil. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside to marinate in a cool place for about 15 minutes, but do not leave any longer or the fish flesh will begin to break down. Serve immediately.
