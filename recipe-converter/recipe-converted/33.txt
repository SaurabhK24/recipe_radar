Ingredients

25g/1oz butter
1 banana shallot, sliced
1 tsp medium curry powder
340g/12oz tin sweetcorn
75ml/3fl oz white wine
200ml/7fl oz double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tsp lemon juice only
100g/3Â½oz picked white crabmeat
drizzle rapeseed oil




Method


Heat a large frying pan until medium hot. Add the butter, shallot and curry powder and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until just softened.


Add the sweetcorn and all the liquid from the tin and then pour in the wine and enough water to just cover.


Bring to a simmer, add half of the cream and then season with salt and black pepper.


Bring the mixture back to the boil, remove from the heat to cool slightly and then transfer to a blender. Bend until smooth and return the soup to the pan to heat though.


Make some soured cream by whisking the remaining cream with the lemon juice until thickened.


Ladle the soup into a serving bowl and then top with a little of the crab, a spoonful of the soured cream and a drizzle of rapeseed oil.
