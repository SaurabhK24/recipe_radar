Ingredients
For the flavourings

100g/3½oz Stilton cheese
75g/2½oz shelled walnuts, roughly chopped
50g/1¾oz sultanas

For the soda bread

300g/10½oz plain white flour, plus extra for dusting
200g/7oz wholemeal flour
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
1 tsp table salt
400ml/14fl oz buttermilk




Method


For the flavourings, crumble the Stilton into a bowl and add the walnuts. Stir in the sultanas and set aside.


For the soda bread, preheat oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Line a baking tray with parchment paper.


Tip the flours, bicarbonate of soda and salt into a bowl. Add the flavourings.


Pour in the buttermilk and mix to a soft dough. Tip out onto a floured surface and gather into a ball. Cut deep slits in the loaf to mark out quarters and dust with flour.


Place the bread on the baking tray and bake for 30 minutes, or until golden-brown and cooked through. The loaf should sound hollow when tapped on the base.


Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.
