For the marinade, mix together all the ingredients in a bowl until well combined. Place the meat into the bowl and massage the marinade into the meat.


Transfer the meat and marinade into a sealable plastic bag and leave in the fridge to chill for at least two hours.

Arrange the salad on individual plates, or a large wooden board, and spoon over the dressing.


Once the meat has been chilled, slice it very thinly and arrange on top of the salad.
