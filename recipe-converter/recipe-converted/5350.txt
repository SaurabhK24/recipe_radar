Ingredients
For the cookie

200g/7oz soft brown sugar
100g/3½oz caster sugar
175g/6oz softened unsalted butter
1 large free-range egg
couple of drops of maple extract
250g/9oz plain flour
pinch salt
¼ tsp baking powder
1 tsp ground cinnamon

For the glaze

1 free-range egg, beaten
ground cinnamon
demerara sugar
cocoa powder

For the ‘baked beans’

1 tbsp icing sugar
red food colouring paste
handful of cinnamon jelly beans

To serve

maple syrup
12 rashers of streaky bacon




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/170C Fan/Gas 4 and line a large rectangular baking tray with silicon paper.


Cream the sugars and butter together until light and fluffy. Add the egg and maple extract and stir to combine.


Sift in the flour, salt, baking powder and cinnamon and mix to form a dough.


Roll the dough to 1cm/½in thickness and shape it to resemble a piece of toast. Carefully place on the baking tray.


Brush the top of the dough with the beaten egg. Sprinkle with cinnamon, demerara sugar and cocoa.


Bake for 30 minutes, or until golden all over but still soft in the middle. Leave to cool for a few minutes before removing from the tray and placing on a wire rack.


For the ‘baked beans', mix together the icing sugar, a little food colouring and water to make a paste. Add the jelly beans and mix together.


Just before serving, heat a large pan and fry the bacon until crisp.


To serve, pour the maple syrup in a jug and place the bacon and ‘baked beans’ alongside the cookie.
