Ingredients

4 Bramley or Granny Smith apples
4 tbsp raisins
2 tbsp mincemeat
2 tbsp ground almonds
570ml/1 pint cider
225g/8oz caster sugar
175ml/6fl oz double cream
55g/2oz butter




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Trim the base of each apple and, using a corer, take the cores out. Cut a small slit all the way round the middle of each apple horizontally.


Mix the raisins, mincemeat and ground almonds and pack them tightly into the cores of the apples.


Place the apples in a baking dish and pour over 450ml/16fl oz cider.


Bake for 25-30 minutes, then leave to stand for 10 minutes.


Pour off the cider from the dish into a saucepan and heat it to reduce it in volume until slightly syrupy. Use the syrup to glaze the apples.


In a pan, heat the sugar and remaining cider together and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and cook until caramelized to a golden-brown colour, then set aside to cool slightly.


Meanwhile in a separate pan, bring the cream to the boil. Pour the cream into the syrup, add the butter and stir well.


Serve the baked apples with the cream syrup.
