A great addition to the Christmas biscuit lexicon, these buttery biscuits are begging to be dipped in melted chocolate.

Ingredients
For the vanilla dough

175g/6oz plain flour, sifted
75g/3oz icing sugar
150g/5oz butter, cubed
dash vanilla extract

For the chocolate dough

150g/5oz plain flour
25g/1oz cocoa powder
150g/5oz butter, cubed

To serve

milk chocolate, for dipping
vanilla ice cream




Method


Preheat the oven to 170C/325F/Gas 3. Grease and line an 18cm/6in square tin with baking parchment.


For the vanilla dough, rub the flour, icing sugar, butter and vanilla extra together in a bowl until the mixture comes together as a dough.


For the chocolate dough, rub the flour, cocoa and butter together until the mixture comes together as a dough.


Roll out both doughs into a sqaure measuring 1cm/½in thick. Place the chocolate dough onto the vanilla dough and press firmly together. (Brush with some water to help the adhesion if required.) Cut the dough in half and then press these two pieces together to produce four layers of dough.


Cut into three even strips and then cut each strip at 5cm/2in intervals to produce biscuit-sized shapes. Place the dough into the baking tin and bake for 15-20 minutes.


Meanwhile, melt the chocolate in a glass bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water.


Serve with ice cream and the chocolate dip.
