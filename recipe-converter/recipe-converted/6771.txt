This whisky cocktail is an out-and-out classic of the 1960s that will make you feel like a sharp-suited Don Draper in no time.

Ingredients

1 thick slice orange peel
1 maraschino cherry, with stem
1 tsp sugar syrup (also sold as gomme syrup)
2-3 drops whisky bitters
ice cubes, as necessary
50ml/2fl oz Scotch or bourbon
twist of lemon peel, to garnish




Method


Take the orange peel and squeeze it with your fingers. Rub the peel around the insides of a whisky tumbler, then place into the glass. Add the cherry, sugar syrup and bitters, along with three ice cubes.


Add half of the scotch or bourbon and stir for about ten seconds. Add more ice and the remaining scotch or bourbon and stir again for 10-15 seconds.


To serve, garnish with lemon peel.
