Ingredients
For the peanut chicken

55g/2oz peanuts, shelled
½ chicken breast, skin removed, sliced into strips
3 tbsp plain flour
1 free-range egg, beaten
2 tbsp vegetable oil

For the pak choi

2 pak choi, split in half lengthways
2 tbsp sesame oil
½ tsp salt
½ red chilli, chopped
2 tbsp soy sauce
½ lime, juice only

For the dressing

2 limes, juice only
2 tbsp brown sugar
2 tbsp soy sauce
½ red chilli, chopped
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander




Method


For the peanut chicken, place the peanuts into a food processor and pulse to crumbs. Tip onto a large plate.


Dust the chicken in the flour, then dip into the beaten egg and finally roll in the peanut crumbs. Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the goujons, in batches, for 2-3 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown, crisp and cooked through.


For the pak choi, mix all of the pak choi ingredients together in a bowl. Heat a chargrill pan until smoking, then tip the pak choi mixture in and cook for 4-5 minutes, turning occasionally, or until the pak choi is wilted and tender.


For the dressing, combine all of the dressing ingredients together in a bowl and mix well.


Serve the pak choi alongside the peanut chicken, with the dressing spooned around the edges of the plate.
