Ingredients

500ml/18fl oz vegetable oil, for deep frying
300g/10½oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting
3 free-range eggs
1 tbsp olive oil
½ tsp ground cinnamon
icing sugar, to dust




Method


Place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


For the pasta, place the flour, eggs and olive oil into a food processor and pulse until combined.


Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly until smooth. Cut the dough in half and set one piece aside.


Roll out one half of the dough until 1cm/½in thick, then feed it through a pasta machine. Start on the thickest setting, passing the sheet through several times and lowering the setting until it reaches the thinnest setting. Cut the pasta sheet into triangle shapes. Repeat the process with the rest of the dough.


Carefully place the pasta triangles into the hot oil and deep fry for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Dust with ground cinnamon and icing sugar.


To serve, place the cinnamon bites into a large serving dish.
