These moreish mushrooms make a great party nibble.






By Antonio Carluccio


From Great British Food Revival






Ingredients

2 tbsp plain flour
1 tsp chopped fresh flatleaf parsley
2 free-range eggs
50ml/2fl oz milk
freshly ground black pepper
vegetable oil, for deep-frying
400g/14oz mixed mushrooms, cleaned, sliced lengthways




Method


Mix the flour and parsley in a wide, shallow bowl. Whisk the eggs, milk and some freshly ground black pepper together in a separate bowl.


Heat the oil in a deep, heavy-based saucepan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Dip the mushroom slices in the egg mixture, then coat with the flour mixture.


Carefully place the mushrooms into the oil and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown. (You may need to do this in batches. Do not overcrowd the pan.)


Remove the mushrooms from the oil with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper.
