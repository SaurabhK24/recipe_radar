By Patrick Williams






Ingredients

200g/1/2lb unsalted butter
3 Spanish onions, peeled and finely sliced
1kg/2.2lb brussels sprouts, peeled and finely shredded
150ml/¼pt vegetable oil
200g/½lb blanched almonds
pinch celery salt
freshly ground pepper




Method


Melt 175g/7oz of the butter in a large sauté pan and gently sweat the onions for 6-8 minutes until softened and caramelised.


Bring a pan of salted water to the boil and blanch the sprouts for 1 minute. Drain and refresh in ice cold water.


Heat the oil in a sauté pan and add the almonds. Fry gently for a few minutes until lightly toasted.


Melt the remaining 25g/1oz of butter in a large sauté pan and sweat the sprouts for 3-4 minutes, tossing, until just softened. Stir the onions and almonds through. Season with celery salt and lots of pepper. Serve at once.
