Ingredients

225g/8oz self-raising flour
100g/3½oz courgette, grated
salt and freshly ground black pepper
100g/3½oz mature cheddar, grated
175ml/6fl oz milk
1 free-range egg
55ml/2fl oz olive oil
10 cherry tomatoes

To serve

crisp grilled bacon
scrambled egg




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, courgette, salt, freshly ground black pepper and cheddar and mix well.


In a separate bowl, mix together the milk, egg and olive oil. Add this mixture to the dry ingredients and mix well.


Grease ten muffin moulds and half-fill each with the mix.


Prick each cherry tomato - this stops them popping when they cook - and press one tomato into the top of each spoonful of mix.


Spoon the remaining mixture over each muffin to conceal the tomato. Cook for about 20 minutes until golden brown.
