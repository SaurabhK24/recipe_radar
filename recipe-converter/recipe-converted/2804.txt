Ingredients

100ml/3½oz olive oil
½ red onion, chopped
4 garlic cloves
1 dried, smoked habanero chilli, chopped
900g/2lb fresh cockles, cleaned and drained (discard any cockles that remain open after cleaning)
250ml/9fl oz white wine
150ml/5fl oz passata
salt and freshly ground black pepper
bunch fresh parsley, chopped

Method


Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and fry for 5-6 minutes, or until softened and just starting to brown.


Add the dried chilli, the cockles, white wine, passata and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Cover the pan with a lid and steam the cockles for 4-5 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until all of the cockles have opened. Discard any cockles that have not opened after five minutes.


To serve, stir in the fresh parsley and spoon into bowls. Serve with crusty bread.
