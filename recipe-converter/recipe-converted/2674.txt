Francesco Maazei favours Mammole, the traditional variety of artichokes from Rome, for this classic Italian dish, but others could be substituted. Whichever variety you use, choose globes that are heavy, firm and plump.

Ingredients

4 artichokes, preferably Mammole variety
1 lemon, cut in half
4 garlic cloves
1 tbsp salt
6 anchovy fillets
20 leaves fresh mint, finely chopped
20 leaves fresh parsley, finely chopped
20 leaves fresh marjoram, finely chopped
2 tbsp grated pecorino
2 tbsp breadcrumbs
2 tbsp olive oil
2 potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
200ml/7fl oz white wine
50ml/2fl oz vegetable stock




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Pull off the tough outer leaves from each artichoke and cut off the stalks. Trim off the tops of the leaves with a pair of kitchen scissors and rub each artichoke with the cut lemon to prevent them from discolouring.


Finely chop one of the garlic cloves and mix it with the salt and the anchovy fillets in a bowl to form a paste.


Add the chopped herbs to the paste with the pecorino and breadcrumbs; mix well.


Rinse the artichokes under cold running water, shake off any excess water and gently prise the artichokes leaves open.


Sprinkle the artichokes with a pinch of salt and rub the paste inside the leaves.


Heat the olive oil in an ovenproof pan. Thinly slice the remaining garlic cloves and add them to the pan, then add the artichokes and potatoes.


Add the white wine, let it bubble and then add the vegetable stock.


Cover the artichokes with greaseproof paper and place a lid on the pan. Bake in the oven for 35-45 minutes. Serve hot or warm.
