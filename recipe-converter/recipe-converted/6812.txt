Ingredients

600ml/1 pint vegetable oil
½ onion, thickly sliced and separated into rings
150ml/¼ pint whole milk
100g/3½oz plain flour, seasoned
Salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Heat the vegetable oil in a wok to 180C/350F or until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous, do not leave unattended.)


Soak the onion rings in the milk for one minute, then dip the onion rings into the seasoned flour and coat well.


Dip the onion rings in the milk again and then again in the flour.


Carefully drop the onion rings into the hot oil and cook for two minutes or until golden brown on all sides.


Remove using a slotted spoon, drain on kitchen paper and serve immediately, sprinkled with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
