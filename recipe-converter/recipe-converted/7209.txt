The star of this show is the tomatoes. So try to find a good, ripe selection of as many shapes, sizes and colours as you can.

Ingredients

2 fist-sized pieces ciabatta bread, or any other unsliced loaf
2 anchovy fillets
3 tbsp drained capers
4 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp red wine vinegar
600g/1lb 2oz tomatoes, chopped
1 bag mixed salad leaves
salt and pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 110C/225F/Gas Â¼ or its lowest setting.


Rip the bread into bite-sized pieces, place on a baking tray and bake for about 20 minutes. Make sure it doesn't burn - what you're looking for is bread that comes out feeling a little stale.


Meanwhile, put the anchovies, two tablespoons of the capers, the oil and vinegar in a pestle and mortar and smash it into a dressing.


Grab yourself a big mixing bowl and put in the tomatoes and bread and pour on the dressing, then get stuck in with your hands. Give it all a gentle squeeze to make sure the spongy bread soaks up all the juices.


Finally tip your salad leaves onto a serving plate and drop the contents of the bowl over the top, finishing off with the remaining capers and some salt and pepper.
