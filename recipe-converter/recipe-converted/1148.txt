Cod and potatoes, always good together, are given extra bite, oven-baked with a sprinkling of sugar to crisp the potatoes, and served with a butter, lemon and caper sauce.

Ingredients

1 medium potato, such as maris piper, peeled, thinly sliced into rounds
75ml/3fl oz clarified butter
1 tbsp icing sugar
700g/1Â½ lbs cod, or white fish, cut into 8 pieces
salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 tbsp olive oil
1 shallot, finely diced
150g/5oz unsalted butter
1 lemon, segmented
1 tbsp capers
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper.


Dip the potato slices in the clarified butter and lay onto the lined baking tray. Sift the icing sugar over the top and cover with another piece of greaseproof paper. Place a heavy baking tray on top and bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes, or until cooked through.


Brush the cod pieces with oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Heat two tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan and fry the cod pieces for one minute on each side, or until cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside.


Add the remaining oil to the pan and fry the shallots for 2-3 minutes, or until softened. Add the butter and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until a pale nut-brown colour.


Add the lemon segments, capers and parsley and remove the pan from the heat.


To serve, divide the fish among four serving plates, spoon over the sauce and top with the potatoes.
