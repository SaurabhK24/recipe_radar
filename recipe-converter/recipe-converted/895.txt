Ingredients
For the venison alla Milanese

4 tbsp fresh white breadcrumbs
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
1 tbsp chopped fresh thyme leaves
pinch chilli flakes
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp butter
85g/3oz venison, flattened out with a meat mallet or rolling pin
1 free-range egg, beaten

For the roasted butternut squash

Â½ butternut squash, peeled and chopped
3 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the herb pesto

4 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
2 tbsp chopped fresh basil
2 tbsp chopped fresh chives
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the venison alla Milanese, place the breadcrumbs, herbs, chilli flakes and salt and freshly ground black pepper into a food processor and pulse until just combined.


Heat the olive oil and butter in a frying pan. Dip the venison into the beaten egg, then coat in the breadcrumb mixture and fry for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown and cooked through.


For the roasted squash, blanch the squash in a pan of boiling salted water for 4-5 minutes, then drain. Transfer to a roasting tin, drizzle over the olive oil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place into the oven to roast for 10-12 minutes, or until golden and tender.


For the herb pesto, place all of the pesto ingredients into a food processor and blend until smooth.


To serve, place the venison on a serving plate and spoon the roasted squash alongside. Drizzle the herb pesto around the edges of the plate to garnish.
