Ingredients

2 tbsp chopped fresh mint
1 tsp finely chopped fresh rosemary
3 garlic cloves
2 tbsp olive oil
4 lean lamb chops or cutlets
1 aubergine, sliced
4 courgettes, sliced
2 red peppers, cut into large chunks
2 yellow peppers, cut into large chunks
85g/3oz feta cheese, crumbled
250g/9oz cherry tomatoes

To serve

mixed leaf salad




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/355F/Gas 4.


Using a pestle and mortar or food processor, blend together the mint, rosemary and the garlic, then add one tablespoon of the olive oil. Smear the herb mixture over the lamb chops.


Place the aubergine, courgette and peppers on a baking sheet. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil and place the lamb chops on top. Place into the oven to roast for 20-25 minutes.


Remove from the oven and top the chops with the feta and add the cherry tomatoes to the tray. Return to the oven for a further 10 minutes until the cheese just starts to brown and the lamb chops are just cooked through.


Serve the chops with the roasted vegetables and mixed leaf salad.
