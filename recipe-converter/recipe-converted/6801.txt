Homemade onion bhajis are well worth the effort, they're great as a starter for an Indian feast.






By Alex Kingston


From A Taste of My Life






Ingredients

2 free-range eggs
3 onions, sliced
120g/4oz plain flour
1 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp cumin seeds
3 tbsp vegetable oil, plus extra if required




Method


Beat the eggs in a bowl.


Add the onion rings and mix well.


Add the flour, ground coriander and cumin seeds and stir well to combine.


Heat the oil in a deep-sided frying pan over a medium heat. When hot add a large spoonful of the bhaji mixture and fry for 30-45 seconds, until golden-brown.


Turn the bhaji over and fry for a further 30 seconds, until crisp and golden-brown all over. Remove and drain on kitchen paper.


Repeat with the remaining bhaji mixture, replenishing the oil in the pan if it runs low and allowing it to heat up again after a new addition.
