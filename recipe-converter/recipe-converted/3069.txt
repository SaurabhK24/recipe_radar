Ingredients
For the nuoc cham

10 small red chillies
5 garlic cloves
5 limes, juice only
1 lemongrass stalk, finely chopped
75ml/3fl oz rice vinegar
75ml/3fl oz water

For the crab salad

250g/10½oz fine rice noodles
250g/10½oz fresh crabmeat (cooked)
1 red onion, very finely sliced
1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
3 lime leaves, finely sliced
half red pepper, finely chopped
half cucumber, seeds removed, finely chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the nuoc cham, place all of the nuoc cham ingredients into a food processor and blend until smooth.


For the crab salad, soak the rice noodles in very hot water for five minutes, or until soft (or cook according to packet instructions - do not overcook). Drain and set aside to cool.


Place all of the remaining salad ingredients into a bowl and mix well, seasoning, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, drizzle a little of the nuoc cham dressing into the noodles and mix well.


Fold half of the crab salad mixture into the noodles, then using a large fork, wrap up a forkful of noodles and gently place into a small bowl to create a 'nest' of noodles. Repeat with three more bowls.


Spoon some of the nuoc cham dressing over each noodle nest.


Top with a spoonful of crab salad mixture, then spoon over a little more dressing.
