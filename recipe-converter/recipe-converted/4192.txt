Ingredients

¼ Bramley apple, finely chopped
50g/2 oz dates, finely chopped
½ lemon, juice only
4 sheets ready-made filo pastry
1 free-range egg, beaten
500ml/18fl oz vegetable oil
2 tbsp honey, to drizzle




Method


Place the apple, date and lemon juice into a bowl and mix together.


On a clean surface lay two sheets of filo pastry out alongside each other on a clean, flat surface. Brush with the egg and lay another sheet over each.


Spoon a little of the fruit mixture into the middle of each sheet at one end. Roll up as you would a spring roll, whilst brushing with the egg so it sticks.


Heat the oil in a deep saucepan until a breadcrumb sizzles in it (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous do not leave unattended) and add the parcels and deep-fry until golden, then carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


To serve, place the fruit roll onto a plate and drizzle with honey.
