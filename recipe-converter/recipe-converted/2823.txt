Ingredients

200g/7oz macadamia nuts
40g/1½oz self-raising flour
pinch of salt
6 eggs, separated
165g/5¾oz sugar
1 lime, zest only, finely grated
45g/1½oz desiccated coconut

For the lime icing

125g/4½oz icing (confectioners') sugar, sifted
2 tbsp lime juice
1 tsp lime zest, finely grated




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Place the nuts, flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor and process until the nuts are ground.


Place the egg yolks and sugar in a separate bowl and beat for three minutes, or until the mixture is pale and creamy. Fold through the zest and coconut, then the nut mixture.


Place the egg whites in a clean, dry, stainless steel bowl and whisk until stiff peaks form. Using a large metal spoon, fold lightly through the nut batter.


Spread the batter evenly into a 23cm (9in) greased or non-stick springform cake tin. Bake for 40 minutes, or until the cake is lightly golden.


Meanwhile, make the icing. Combine all the icing ingredients in a bowl and mix until smooth and glossy.


Remove from the oven and leave to sit for 10 minutes in the tin. Turn the cake out onto a serving plate. Spread the lime icing over the warm cake, allowing it to drizzle down the sides.


Serve.
