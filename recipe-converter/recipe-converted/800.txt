Ingredients

200g/7oz coconut oil, plus extra for greasing
100g/3½oz cocoa powder
6 tbsp maple syrup
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp orange extract
pinch salt
60g/2¼oz goji berries (available from health-food stores)
½ organic orange, zest only, julienned




Method


Grease a small rectangular glass dish (approximately 17cm/7in x 11cm/4in) with a little coconut oil. Line with baking parchment.


Heat the coconut oil in a saucepan over a low heat until melted. Whisk in the cocoa powder until smooth and well combined.


Stir in the maple syrup, vanilla extract, orange extract and salt until well combined, then stir in almost all of the goji berries, reserving a small handful for decoration.


Pour the fudge mixture into the prepared tin, then sprinkle over the remaining goji berries and the orange zest, pressing them gently onto the surface.


Chill in the fridge for 1 hour, or until set.


Slice with a sharp knife and serve.




Recipe Tips
Tip 1: Use organic oranges as these are unwaxed. To remove the wax from non-organic oranges, pour a kettleful of just-boiled water over the fruit. When the fruit is cool enough to handle, scrub the skin with a small brush, then rinse under cold water and pat dry.

  Tip 2: The coconut oil may start to solidify before you get it into the tin. It doesn't matter, just spread it in and smooth using a palette knife.

  Tip 3: For clean lines plunge the knife into boiling water before cutting.
