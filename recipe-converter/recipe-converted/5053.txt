Ingredients
For the honey-glazed grilled pheasant

½ pheasant, backbone removed
2 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp honey
1 tsp coarsely ground black pepper

For the cheesy celeriac mash

½ celeriac, peeled and cubed
salt and freshly ground black pepper
100g/3½oz Wensleydale cheese with cranberries

To serve

small handful fresh rocket leaves
olive oil, for drizzling




Method


Heat a griddle pan until hot. Drizzle the pheasant with olive oil, honey and black pepper and place into the pan. Weigh the meat down with another pan on top and chargrill the pheasant for 5-6 minutes on either side, or until cooked through.


For the celeriac mash, bring a pan of salted water to the boil. Cook the celeriac until tender, about 8-10 minutes. Drain and crush with a fork or potato masher. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and crumble in the cheese. Stir until the cheese has melted.


Serve the mash on one side of a serving plate and the pheasant on the other. Garnish with some rocket drizzled with a little olive oil.
