Ingredients

500g/1lb 2oz dry conchiglie pasta
50g/2oz salted butter
200g/7oz soft cheese, such as mascarpone or ricotta
100g/3½oz parmesan cheese, freshly grated
150g/5½oz cheddar cheese
1 glass full fat-milk, at room temperature
200g/7oz leftover turkey and stuffing, chopped
3tbsp fresh flatleaf parsley, roughly chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste




Method


Preheat the oven on 180C/360F/Gas 4.


Cook the pasta in salted boiling water until al dente.


Drain the pasta and place back into the saucepan. Add in the butter and the cheeses excluding half of the parmesan.


Mix well and then add in the milk. Return the saucepan to a low heat and stir until you get a creamy-textured sauce.


Add the turkey, the stuffing and the flatleaf parsley and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Transfer the pasta mixture to a large baking tray. Sprinkle over the remaining parmesan cheese and place in a pre-heated oven to bake for 15 minutes, until the top is golden and crispy.


Remove from the oven and serve immediately.
