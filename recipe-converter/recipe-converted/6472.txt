Ingredients

100g/3Â½oz monkfish
3 tbsp butter

For crushed potatoes

4 potatoes, peeled and cooked
1 tbsp butter
1 tsp Dijon mustard
1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
1 tbsp fresh chives, chopped

For the shallot dressing

1 tbsp shallots, finely chopped
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp lemon juice
1 tsp chives, chopped




Method


Melt the butter in a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the monkfish and cook for three minutes on each side.


For the crushed potatoes, crush the boiled and drained potatoes roughly with a fork and add the butter, Dijon mustard, parsley and chives and mix well.


For the shallot dressing, heat the chopped shallots and olive oil in a small pan. Warm through and remove from the heat.


Add the lemon juice and, once cooled, add the chives.


To serve, place the crushed potatoes in the centre of the plate. Place the monkfish on top and drizzle the dressing around.
