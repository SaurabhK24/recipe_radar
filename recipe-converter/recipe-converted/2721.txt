Ingredients

3 oranges, peeled and segmented
¼ tsp ground cinnamon
3 free-range egg whites
100g/3½oz caster sugar
icing sugar, to dust
fresh mint sprigs, to garnish




Method


Divide the oranges between two large dessert glasses and sprinkle over the cinnamon.


In a large clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed.


Gradually add the caster sugar, whisking continuously until the mixture is thick and glossy.


Pipe or spoon the meringue mixture into the glasses to cover the oranges. Use a mini-blowtorch to brown the meringue all over.


To serve, dust with icing sugar and garnish with a sprig of mint.
