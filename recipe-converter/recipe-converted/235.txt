This deliciously zingy tequila-marinated salmon would make a smart starter or canapé. Serve with slices of pumpernickel bread.

Ingredients
For the salmon

1kg/2lb 2oz side of salmon, skin on, pin-boned
2 tbsp yellow mustard seeds
1 tbsp cumin seeds
4 red chillis, finely chopped
3 limes, zest only
300g/10½oz sea salt
300g/10½oz soft light brown sugar
300ml/10½oz tequila

For the goats’ cheese dip

200g/7oz soft goats’ cheese
100g/3½oz Greek-style yoghurt
dash warm water
1 tbsp chopped fresh mint
1 tbsp chopped lemonbalm
1 lime, zest and juice




Method


Place a large piece of aluminium foil on a baking tray and cover with clingfilm. Place the salmon on top, skin-side down. Pat the fish dry with kitchen paper.


Toast the mustard seeds and cumin for 2-3 minutes over a medium heat. Place the spices into a pestle and mortar and grind to a coarse mixture. Add the chilli and lime zest to the spices and mix until well combined. Spread the mixture over the salmon and press well into the flesh.


Place the salt, sugar and tequila in a bowl and mix until well combined. Spread over the salmon.


Gather the clingfilm and foil and tightly wrap around the salmon. Place another baking tray on top of the fish and weigh it down with heavy weights. Chill in the fridge for 48 hours.


For the goats’ cheese dip place all the ingredients in a bowl and mix until well combined.


Slice the salmon into thin strips. Serve with the dip and slices of pumpernickel bread.
