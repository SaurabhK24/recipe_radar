If you're stuck with less than fresh hot cross buns, soak them in gorgeous eggy custard for an Easter monday pud.

Ingredients
For the custard

6 free-range egg yolks
2 free-range eggs
150g/5oz caster sugar
300ml/½ pint whole milk
300ml/½ pint double cream
1 vanilla pod, split, seeds scraped out
75g/2½oz butter
8 ready-made hot cross buns, halved
25g/1oz sultanas
25g/1oz raisins
25g/1oz demerara sugar




Method


For the custard, whisk the egg yolks, whole eggs and sugar together in a bowl.


Place the milk, cream and the vanilla pod and seeds into a pan over a low heat and slowly bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat and remove the vanilla pod.


Pour the milk and cream onto the egg mixture and whisk well.


Butter the hot cross buns, then cut into quarters.


Place a layer of the hot cross buns into a 22cm/9in x 10cm/4in, 5cm/2in deep ovenproof dish.


Sprinkle with some sultanas and raisins and the demerara sugar. Repeat the layers and finish with a final layer of buns.


Pour the custard over the buns and leave to stand for 20 minutes.


Preheat the oven to 180C/355F/Gas 4.


Place the dish into a deep roasting tray and add enough water to the tray to come a third of the way up the dish (this is a bain-marie). Cover with foil.


Carefully place the pudding and bain-marie into the oven and bake for 20-30 minutes, or until the custard has set. Remove the foil for the final five minutes of cooking to brown the top.


Serve the pudding with cream or mascarpone.
