Ingredients
For the fritters

150g/5½oz self-raising flour
3 free-range eggs
1 tsp baking powder
100g/3½oz canned sweetcorn, rinsed and drained
1 tsp chilli flakes
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil
25g/1oz butter

For the tomato salsa

1 beef tomato, seeds removed, chopped
1 lime, juice and zest
1 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the fritters, place the flour, eggs and baking powder into a bowl and mix well.


Add the sweetcorn and chilli flakes, season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir.


Heat the oil and butter in a pan and place spoonfuls of the sweetcorn mixture into the pan. Fry the fritters for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown. Remove from the pan and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter.


For the tomato salsa, place all of the salsa ingredients into a bowl and stir to combine.


To serve, place the fritters onto a serving plate and spoon over the salsa.
