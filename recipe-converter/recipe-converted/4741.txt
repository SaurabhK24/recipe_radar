Ingredients
For the baked apple

55g/2oz raisins
30g/1oz butter
1 tbsp clear honey
1 orange, zest only
1 apple, cored

For the custard

5 tbsp milk
5 tbsp double cream
2 tbsp caster sugar
1 free-range egg
1 free-range egg yolk




Method


For the baked apple, place the raisins, butter, honey and orange zest into a small bowl and mix well.


Place the apple onto a microwave-proof plate and stuff the raisin mixture into the hole left by removing the core.


Cook in the microwave on high for 3½ minutes, or until softened.


For the custard, place the milk and cream into a saucepan and bring up to the boil. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.


Place the egg and egg yolk and the sugar into a bowl and mix well. Gradually pour the milk and cream over the egg mixture, then return the mixture to the pan over a gentle heat. Stir constantly until the custard starts to thicken. When it coats the back of a spoon, remove from the heat and pour through a sieve into a jug or bowl.


To serve, place the baked apple onto a plate and pour over the custard.
