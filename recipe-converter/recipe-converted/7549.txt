Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
1 red pepper, seeded and sliced into eight strips
1 yellow pepper, seeded and sliced into eight strips
10 cherry tomatoes, halved
2 tsp harissa paste
450g/1lb jar of cooked chickpeas in water
salt
½ lemon, juice only
handful fresh basil leaves




Method


Pour the olive oil into a large frying pan over a medium heat.


Add the sliced red and yellow pepper to the pan and allow to soften for 2-3 minutes.


Add the cherry tomatoes to the pan and cook for a further two minutes, gently squashing the tomatoes with a wooden spoon to release their juices.


Mix in the harissa paste.


Carefully pour the chickpeas, and the water in which they were stored, into the pan. Stir, then allow them to heat through thoroughly for 3-4 minutes.


Season with salt and the juice of half a lemon.


Add a handful of fresh basil leaves right at the end of cooking, so they wilt under the residual heat. Serve immediately.
