Ingredients

vegetable oil, for greasing
2 tbsp ready-made toffee sauce
1 ripe banana, peeled, sliced
70g/3oz self-raising flour
70g/3oz butter, softened
70g/3oz caster sugar
½ tsp mixed spice
1 free-range egg, beaten
custard, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease the base and sides of an ovenproof dish with the oil, then place the dish onto a baking tray.


Drizzle the toffee sauce evenly into the bottom of the dish.


Arrange a layer of the sliced banana in the dish, keeping a few slices back for decoration.


Beat the flour, butter, sugar and mixed spice together in a mixing bowl until fluffy and well combined. Gradually beat in the egg until the mixture is smooth and all of the egg has been incorporated.


Spread the sponge mixture evenly over the banana and toffee layers using a spatula. Top with the remaining slices of banana.


Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the sponge has risen and is golden-brown. Serve with custard.
