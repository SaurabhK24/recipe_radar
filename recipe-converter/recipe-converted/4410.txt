Ingredients

½ red onion, finely chopped
3-4 sprigs tarragon, leaves picked and finely chopped
1 tbsp good-quality white wine vinegar (preferably Moscatel vinegar)
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
vegetable oil, for frying
2 rashers streaky bacon, diced
2 slices good-quality sourdough bread
2 portions goats’ cheese (either individual crottins or slices from a larger log)
1 handful toasted hazelnuts, lightly crushed
200g/7oz good-quality mixed salad leaves
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


In a salad bowl, mix the red onion, tarragon, vinegar and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.


Heat a little oil in a frying pan, add the bacon and fry until crisp. Drain on kitchen paper.


Heat the grill to high. Toast the bread on both sides and grill the goats’ cheese until golden-brown and bubbling.


Add the hazelnuts, bacon and salad leaves to the bowl.


Place the goats’ cheese on the toast and toss the salad making sure it is well coated with dressing.


Arrange on a plate and serve.




Recipe Tips
If you don’t fancy hazelnuts, you could always get a bit of extra crunch from a few croûtons (although the crust on the sourdough toast should be great anyway) or substitute them for pine nuts. If you’re not a fan of goats’ cheese this salad would also make a great accompaniment to roast chicken.
