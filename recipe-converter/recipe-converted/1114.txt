Beautiful crisp edges and a soft custardy middle - this is what every girl looks for in a bread and butter pudding.






By Nigella Lawson


From A Taste of My Life






Ingredients

3 free-range eggs
3 tbsp caster sugar
2 cups milk and cream mixed together, half and half
½ tsp vanilla extract
1 loaf white bread, croissants, brioche or panettone
50g/20z butter
large handful raisins, soaked in Marsala
double cream or custard, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Mix the eggs, sugar, milk and vanilla extract together in a large bowl.


Slice the bread of your choice, toast and butter it and arrange in overlapping slices in the bottom of an ovenproof dish, leaving some edges sticking out at the top so that they crisp up. Scatter the soaked raisins over the top and then pour in the egg mixture.


Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven and serve warm with cream or custard.
