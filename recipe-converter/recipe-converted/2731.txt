Levi's colourful starter with a zingy chilli-honey dressing is a light and refreshing start to a meal.






By Levi Roots






Ingredients
For the chilli-honey dressing

5 tsp white wine vinegar
4 tsp clear honey
salt and freshly ground black pepper
5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 small red chilli, cut in half, seeds removed, finely chopped

For the salad

4 small oranges, peeled, pith removed, segmented
2 ruby grapefruit, peeled, pith removed, segmented
1 plain grapefruit, peeled, pith removed, segmented
1 small red onion, peeled, very finely sliced
bunch fresh mint leaves, torn
1 pomegranate, seeds only, to serve




Method


For the chilli-honey dressing, mix together the vinegar and honey in a shallow serving bowl until well combined. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Gradually whisk in the oil, using a fork, then add the chilli and whisk again. Add more vinegar or oil, to taste.


For the salad, arrange the segmented fruit in a broad shallow bowl.


Sprinkle over the onion and mint, then pour over the chilli-honey dressing and mix well until it coats the salad.


Just before serving, sprinkle the pomegranate seeds over the salad.
