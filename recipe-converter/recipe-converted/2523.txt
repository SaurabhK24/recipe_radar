Ingredients

1 punnet strawberries (with stalks if possible)
1 packet cape gooseberries
225g/½lb cherries with stalks, washed
200g/7oz block of quality dark chocolate (70% cocoa solids if possible), broken into pieces




Method


Line a baking sheet or tray with greaseproof paper.


Heat some water to boiling point in a saucepan.


Place the chocolate into a large heatproof bowl and place it over the pan of boiling water. Make sure the base of the bowl does not come into contact with the water. Stir until the chocolate is melted.


Expose the berries of the cape gooseberries by pulling back the papery skins.


Hold onto these papery skins and onto the stalks of the fruit, and dip each piece of fruit into the melted chocolate. Place them on the greaseproof paper and leave to set in a cool place for 2 hours.


Serve with after-dinner coffee.
