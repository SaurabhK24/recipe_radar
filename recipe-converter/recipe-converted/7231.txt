Here’s a delightful little starter. Make the plum chutney in advance and assemble the parcels just before serving.

Ingredients
For the plum chutney

75g/3oz caster sugar
500g/1lb 2oz plums, stoned and roughly chopped
1 onion, diced
50ml/2fl oz malt vinegar
1 star anise
½ tsp ground cinnamon
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the mozzarella

8 slices Parma ham, cut in half lengthways
4 balls buffalo mozzarella, drained and cut into quarters
3 tbsp olive oil
2 tsp sesame seeds
8 slices ciabatta




Method


For the plum chutney, heat a frying pan until hot, add the caster sugar and cook until melted and a light golden-brown colour.


Add the chopped plums, onion, vinegar, star anise and cinnamon and cook for 5-8 minutes, or until the plums are tender and slightly pulpy.


Season with a little salt and freshly ground black pepper and set aside to cool. If making in advance, store the chutney in an air-tight container in the fridge.


For the mozzarella, wrap the slices of Parma ham around the mozzarella and set aside.


Heat a large frying pan until hot, add one tablespoon of the olive oil and fry the parcels on each side until just crisp and the mozzarella is just starting to ooze.


Sprinkle over the sesame seeds.


Heat a griddle pan until searing hot, then drizzle the rest of the olive oil over the ciabatta and place onto the griddle.


Char-grill on each side for 1-2 minutes, or until golden-brown.


To serve, spoon some chutney onto each of four plates, lay the wedges of mozzarella alongside and serve with the bread.
