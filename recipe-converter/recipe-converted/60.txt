Ingredients
For the cake

110g/4oz plain flour
1 free-range egg
splash of carbonated water
55g/2oz soft brown sugar
1 vanilla pod, split and seeds scraped out
55g/2oz egg noodles, cooked
knob of butter

For the caramelised mango

juice of 1 orange
55g/2oz soft-brown sugar
1 mango, peeled, stone removed and sliced
Greek yoghurt, to serve




Method


Pre-heat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


To make the cake, place the flour in a large bowl and beat in the egg. Whisk in enough carbonated water to create a batter the consistency of double cream.


Add the sugar and vanilla seeds and stir in.


Add the cooked noodles and stir well.


Gently melt the butter in a small oven-proof non-stick frying pan. Pour in the cake mixture and cook for 3-5 minutes to set. Transfer to the oven and cook for 10-12 minutes, until golden and cooked through.


To make the sauce, heat the orange juice and sugar in a pan over a medium heat to form a caramel.


Add the mango slices and shake the pan to ensure all the mango is coated in caramel. Cook for 3-4 more minutes until the mango is caramelised.


To serve, remove the noodle cake from the oven and turn out onto a plate. Pour the caramelised mangoes over the top and serve with a dollop of Greek yoghurt.
