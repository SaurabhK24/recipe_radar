Ingredients
For the cake

100g/4oz soft butter or baking spread
100g/4oz caster sugar
2 large free-range eggs
100g/4oz self-raising flour
1 tsp baking powder
50g/2oz chopped walnuts
1 tbsp coffee essence

For the filling and topping

75g/3oz butter, softened
225g/8oz icing sugar, sifted
2 tsp milk
2 tsp coffee essence
8 walnut halves, to decorate




Method


For the cake, preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease and line the bases of two 18cm/7in diameter sandwich tins with baking parchment.


Beat together all the cake ingredients in a large bowl with an electric hand whisk until well combined and smooth.


Divide the mixture between the cake tins and gently spread out with a spatula. Bake for 20-25 minutes until an inserted skewer comes out clean. Allow to stand for five minutes before turning onto a wire rack to cool. Peel off the parchment paper.


For the filling and topping, beat the butter and gradually add the icing sugar. When all the icing sugar is added, add the milk and coffee essence and beat until smooth.


When the cakes have cooled, spread half the coffee icing on one cake and sandwich together with the other half.


Ice the top of the cake with the remaining coffee icing and decorate with walnut pieces.
