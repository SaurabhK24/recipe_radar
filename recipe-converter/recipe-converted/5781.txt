Ingredients

1 packet ready-rolled puff pastry
egg wash
lemon curd




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Take a packet of ready rolled puff pastry and cut in half (reserve the other half for another recipe). Using one half score a line about 2.5cm/1in inside the edge all round the pastry.


Using a fork prick the pastry inside the line all over.


Brush the pastry outside the line with egg wash and then bake the pie case in the hot oven for 15-20 minutes until well coloured.


Allow to cool, then spread over the lemon curd.
