A quick and easy veggie nibble for summer parties. Serve with glasses of fizz and elderflower cordial.



Ingredients

150g/5oz ready-made puff pastry
flour, for dusting
25g/1oz cream cheese
10 asparagus spears
1 free-range egg, beaten
2 tbsp freshly grated parmesan (or a similar vegetarian hard cheese)




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Roll the puff pastry out on a floured surface into an 15cmx25cm/6inx10in rectangle and spread all over with the cream cheese.


Using a sharp knife, cut the pastry into 10 long, thin strips.


Wrap one pastry strip in a spiral around each asparagus spear and place onto a baking tray. Lightly brush each with beaten egg then scatter over the parmesan.


Bake the cigars in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the pastry has risen and is golden-brown.
