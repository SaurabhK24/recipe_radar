Ingredients
For the romesco sauce

30g/1oz toasted almonds
30g/1oz toasted walnuts
200g/7oz roasted, skinned red peppers from a jar such as piquillo
¼ tsp hot smoked paprika
¼ tsp cayenne pepper
1 slice stale sourdough bread
1 tsp tomato paste
sherry vinegar to taste (about 2 tsp)
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the mackerel

olive oil
1/5 small new season pumpkin, such as Ironbark, skin and seeds removed, cut into 1cm/½ in dice
8 small porcini mushrooms, cleaned and trimmed and cut into thick slices
1 small hispi cabbage, cut into wedges and core removed
juice of half a lemon
4 thick mackerel fillets, cut into 2 on the angle and skin scored




Method


For the romesco sauce put all the ingredients in a blender, season and blend until you have a coarse purée. Set aside.


Heat a splash of olive oil in a sauté pan over a medium heat. Add the pumpkin and season well. Cook slowly for 5-6 minutes until lightly browned and just tender. Set aside.


Heat a large griddle pan over a medium heat. Drizzle the porcini and cabbage wedges with oil and cook in the grill pan, turning as you go, until just cooked and lightly charred. Remove from the pan, squeeze over a little lemon juice and set aside.


Clean the griddle pan and turn up to maximum heat. Rub the mackerel with olive oil and season well. Place skin side down and cook for 3 minutes to lightly char before turning and cooking for a further 2 minutes. The mackerel should still be a little pink.


To serve, pile the porcini, pumpkin and cabbage onto a plate then top with the grilled mackerel and spoon around the romesco sauce.
