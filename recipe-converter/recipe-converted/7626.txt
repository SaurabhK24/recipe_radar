Ingredients

large round loaf of bread (rustic cob)
2 tbsp olive oil
2 handful salad leaves
4 slices mature cheddar
4 slices salami
4 slices ham
small handful fresh basil, shredded
400g/14oz cherry tomatoes, quartered




Method


Slice the loaf into three horizontal slices of the same width.


Put the top slice to one side. Brush the other two pieces of bread with a little of the oil.


Top each slice of oiled bread with a handful of salad leaves, the cheddar, salami and ham. Sprinkle over the basil and tomatoes and season with freshly ground black pepper.


Put the loaf back together by placing the two covered slices of bread on top of each other. Put the top piece back on like a lid. Wrap the loaf tightly in cling film.


Put the loaf in the fridge, top with a large dinner plate and place a couple of tins on top to weigh it down. Chill for 1-2 hours.


To serve, cut the loaf into wedges.
