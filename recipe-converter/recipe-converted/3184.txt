Ingredients

2 tbsp olive oil
4 spring onions, chopped
200ml/7fl oz white wine
200ml/7fl oz vegetable stock
85g/3oz rocket leaves, plus extra for garnish
1 head Little Gem lettuce, chopped
3 tbsp double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 slice white bread
1 garlic clove, crushed
2 chopped fresh mint leaves, to serve




Method


Preheat the grill to high.


Heat one tablespoon of the oil in a pan and gently fry the spring onions for 2-3 minutes, or until softened. Add the wine and simmer for 5-6 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half.


Stir in the stock, bring to the boil and add the rocket and lettuce. Reduce the heat and simmer for 3-4 minutes, stir in the cream and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Blend until smooth with a stick blender.


Drizzle the remaining oil over the slice of bread, scatter the garlic over and toast under the grill until golden-brown and crisp.


To serve, return the soup to the pan to warm through if needed, then ladle into a serving bowl and serve with the garlic crouton. Garnish with rocket leaves and chopped mint leaves.
