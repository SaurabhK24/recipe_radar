Ingredients
For the garlic bread

3 slices parma ham
50ml/2fl oz olive oil
3 garlic cloves, whole
1 croissant, cut in half crosswise

For the poached eggs

50ml/2fl oz white wine vinegar
2 free-range eggs
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the garlic bread, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and lay the parma ham on a baking tray.


Place the ham in the oven and roast for eight minutes until crisp.


Allow the ham to cool - it will harden slightly.


Heat the olive oil in a small frying pan and add the garlic. Add the croissant halves to the pan and fry until a deeper golden-brown on both sides.


For the poached eggs, bring a small saucepan of water and the vinegar to a simmer over a medium heat.


Carefully crack the eggs into two small ramekins, being careful not to break the yolks.


Gently add the eggs to the water. Turn down the heat and place a lid on the pan.


Cook the eggs for two minutes until the white is firm.


Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and press the base of the spoon against a sheet of kitchen paper to drain.


To serve, place the ham and fried croissant on a plate and arrange the egg on top. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
