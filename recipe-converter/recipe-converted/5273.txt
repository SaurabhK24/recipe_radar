Ingredients

125g/4½oz caster sugar
50g/1¾oz toasted flaked almonds
squeeze lemon juice




Method


Melt the caster sugar in a frying pan until it turns golden or reaches 300C/570F on a sugar thermometer - take care here as the sugar will be very hot.


Add the almonds and lemon juice, stir well and then spoon onto a silicon-lined baking sheet.


Leave to cool and then cut into wedges with a sharp knife.


Serve piled high in a small bowl.
