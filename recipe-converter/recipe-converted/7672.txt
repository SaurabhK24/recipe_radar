Ingredients
For the beef

1 tbsp pine nuts
1 tbsp butter
25g/1oz Stilton
small chunk bread
small handful fresh herbs, such as chervil, chives, parsley and sage, leaves only
1 x 100g/3½oz piece beef fillet
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil

For the salad

1 tbsp butter
¼ savoy cabbage, finely chopped
2 tsp wholegrain mustard
2 ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the beef, place the pine nuts, butter, Stilton, bread and herbs into a blender and pulse to combine.


Season the beef fillet all over with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Press the crust onto the beef to coat it.


Heat the olive oil in an ovenproof frying pan over a medium-high heat and fry the beef crust-side up for 2-3 minutes.


Transfer to the oven to finish cooking for 5-6 minutes, or until the crust is golden-brown and the beef is cooked to your liking. Leave to rest for five minutes.


For the warm cabbage and tomato salad, heat the butter in a frying pan and gently cook the cabbage until tender. Add the mustard and tomatoes, stir well to combine and warm through. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, place the cabbage salad onto a plate and top with the beef.
