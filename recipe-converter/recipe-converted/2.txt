1 free-range egg, lightly beaten
150g/5oz plain flour
1 tsp baking powder
½ tsp salt
1 tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp grated nutmeg
100g/3½oz pecans, roughly chopped
3 medium apples (mix of granny smith and golden delicious), peeled, cored, chopped into small pieces

2 tbsp finely chopped stem ginger

For the rum caramel sauce

200g/7oz caster sugar
250ml/8floz whipping cream

Method


For the apple and plum cake, preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease and line a 23cm/9in deep, round cake tin.


Beat the butter and sugar together in a bowl until light and fluffy. Add the egg and two tablespoons of flour and mix until well combined.


Beat in the remaining flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon and nutmeg and until just combined.


Stir in the remaining ingredients.


Pour the mixture into the cake tin and bake for 35-45 minutes, or until golden-brown and springy to the touch.


Remove the pudding from the oven and set aside to cool slightly.


Meanwhile, for the rum caramel sauce, heat the sugar in a saucepan for 4-5 minutes, or until it becomes caramel. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool slightly.


Heat the cream in a saucepan set over a medium heat, then whisk it into the caramel to form a smooth sauce. Stir in the vanilla and add the rum, to taste.


To serve, cut the pudding into wedges and serve with the rum caramel sauce.
