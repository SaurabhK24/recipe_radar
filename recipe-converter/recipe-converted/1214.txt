The best and most tasty mushrooms you can find in Italy are the porcini wild mushrooms or ceps. Autumn is the best season to eat them, when you will find them fresh on the menu in almost every Italian restaurant.

Ingredients

450g/1lb chestnut mushrooms, sliced
55g/2oz dried porcini mushrooms
2 cloves garlic
75ml/3fl oz olive oil
salt and pepper
fresh parsley, chopped
1 day old French baguette




Method


Soak the dried mushrooms in hot water for at least one hour.


In a large frying pan heat the olive oil and sauté the garlic for 2 minutes.


Add the sliced mushrooms and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes.


Add the dried mushrooms and some of the water, strained through kitchen paper, in which the mushrooms have been soaking.


Cover and simmer for about 10 minutes or until the volume of liquid has reduced.


Sprinkle with the chopped parsley and serve warm.


Or, add some cream or marscapone to make a creamy sauce for pasta and top with parmesan and butter.


To serve with crostini, slice the baguette on the diagonal and dry it out in the oven, but do not colour it.
