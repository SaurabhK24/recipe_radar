Ingredients

85g/3oz green beans, trimmed
1 tbsp butter
1 tbsp caster sugar
½ pear, cored, peeled and sliced
½ carrot, peeled and grated
handful fresh coriander, leaves only
30g/1oz Brie, chopped
1 tbsp olive oil
¼ lemon, zest and juice




Method


Bring a pan of salted water to the boil and blanch the green beans for two minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water, then drain again.


Heat the butter and caster sugar together in a small non-stick frying pan until the sugar has melted.


Add the sliced pear to the pan and cook for two minutes, or until well coated and caramelised but still holding its shape.


In a bowl, mix the carrot, coriander leaves and Brie together and stir in the blanched green beans.


Drizzle the green bean mixture with the olive oil and lemon juice and stir in the lemon zest.


To serve, pile the green bean mixture onto a serving plate and top with the caramelised pear.
