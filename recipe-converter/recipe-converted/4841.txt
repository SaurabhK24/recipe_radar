Ingredients

1 réblochon cheese (or other cheese in a box)
1 sprig fresh rosemary
2 slices bread
1 tbsp olive oil




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Spear the cheese with the rosemary sprig. Place on a baking sheet and place in the oven to bake for ten minutes, or until the cheese is melted and hot inside.


Meanwhile, heat a griddle pan. Add the bread and toast for 1-2 minutes on each side. Remove the toast and brush with the olive oil.


To serve, place the melted cheese in the centre of a plate, surrounded by the toast pieces.
