Ingredients

2 tbsp olive oil
4 asparagus spears
55g/2oz sunblush tomatoes
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp chopped fresh chives
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander leaves
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar




Method


Heat up a griddle pan over a medium heat. Pour the olive oil into a shallow bowl and coat the asparagus with the oil.


Place the oiled asparagus and sunblush tomatoes onto a griddle pan. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Griddle for 4-5 minutes, turning over halfway through cooking, or until golden-brown griddle marks appear on the asparagus and tomatoes.


Scatter the chives and coriander over the asparagus and tomatoes. Transfer to a serving plate.


Add the vinegar to the pan and simmer for 10-20 seconds, stirring until slightly reduced. Pour the reduced vinegar over the asparagus and tomatoes and serve.
