Ingredients
For the stuffed mushrooms

2 Portobello mushrooms, stalks removed
85g/3oz goats' cheese
drizzle olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 lemon, zest only
2 tbsp fresh white breadcrumbs
2 sprigs thyme, leaves only

For the herb salad

large handful fresh basil leaves
large handful fresh parsley leaves
large handful fresh coriander leaves
drizzle extra virgin olive oil
1 lemon, juice only




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the stuffed mushrooms, place the mushrooms onto a serving plate, top with the goats' cheese and drizzle with olive oil. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Place the lemon zest, breadcrumbs and thyme in a mini blender. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and blend to combine.


Spoon the breadcrumb mixture over the mushrooms and drizzle with a little extra olive oil. Transfer to the oven to bake for ten minutes or until the crumbs are golden-brown on top and the mushrooms are cooked through.


For the herb salad, mix the herbs together with a drizzle of olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice, to taste.


To serve, place a mushroom onto each of two serving plates and garnish with the herb salad.
