Ingredients

4 sheets ready-made filo pastry
55g/2oz butter, melted
100g/3½oz Lancashire cheese, grated
12 prunes, stones removed




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Cut each sheet of filo pastry into three long strips and brush with melted butter.


Place a small spoonful of cheese at one end of each strip and top with a prune.


Fold one corner of the pastry over the filling to the opposite side to make a triangle. Continue folding up until all the pastry is used up and brush all over with butter. Repeat to make 12 parcels.


Place onto a baking sheet and bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp.


To serve, place onto a serving plate.
