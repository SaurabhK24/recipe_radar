Ingredients
For the vermouth sauce

25g/1oz unsalted butter
2 shallots, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
2 tbsp vermouth
300ml/10½fl oz fish stock
225ml/8fl oz double cream

For the pan-fried cod with a parsley crust

140g/5oz breadcrumbs
55g/2oz fresh flatleaf parsley
6 tbsp olive oil
4 x 175g/6¼oz cod fillets, skin on

For the sautéed girolles

25g/1oz unsalted butter
100g/3½oz girolle mushrooms
2 tbsp flatleaf parsley, finely chopped




Method


For the vermouth sauce, melt the butter in a frying pan and fry the shallots and garlic for 2-3 minutes. De-glaze the pan with the vermouth and cook until the volume of the liquid has reduced by half. Add the fish stock and cream and cook again until the volume of the liquid has reduced by half.


Blend the mixture in a blender and pass the sauce through a sieve.


For the pan-fried cod with a parsley crust, preheat the grill to the highest setting.


Blend the breadcrumbs, parsley and four tablespoons of the olive oil in a food processer until well combined.


Roll the mixture out on a work surface and cut out four pieces the same size as the cod fillets.


Meanwhile, heat the remaining olive oil in a frying pan and fry the cod, skin-side down, for 2-3 minutes.


Remove the cod fillets from the pan, peel off the skin and place the parsley crust on top.


Grill the cod fillets for 2-3 minutes.


For the sautéed girolles, melt the butter in a frying pan, fry the mushrooms for 2-3 minutes, then stir in the chopped parsley.


To serve, spoon the mushrooms around each of four serving plates, place a cod fillet into the centre of each plate and spoon around the vermouth sauce.
