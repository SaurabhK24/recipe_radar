Ingredients

2 tbsp butter
1kg/2¼lb onions, roughly chopped
500ml/18fl oz medium-dry cider
1 tbsp cider vinegar
pinch dried thyme
1 small bay leaf
2 litres/3½ pints chicken stock (vegetarians can substitute with vegetable stock)
225g/8oz potato, peeled and diced
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the Stilton butter

4 tbsp butter, room temperature
2 tbsp single cream
4 tbsp Stilton (or Cashel Blue), crumbled, room temperature
1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
1 tbsp fresh chives, chopped

To garnish

onions fried in butter and fresh chervil




Method


Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan, add the onions and cook gently over a medium heat for 15 minutes, or until soft and lightly browned.


Add the cider and cider vinegar and boil until reduced by about a half.


Add the thyme, bay leaf, chicken stock, potato and a little salt. Bring to a simmer, and cook for about 15 minutes over a low heat.


Remove the bay leaf and purée the soup with a hand blender until smooth. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To make the Stilton butter, mix all the ingredients together in a bowl until they are well blended.


To serve, ladle the hot soup into warm bowls. Add 1 tbsp of the Stilton butter to each bowl and garnish with fried onions and chervil
