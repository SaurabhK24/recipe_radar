Ingredients
For the fondants

40g/1½oz butter
65g/2¼oz smooth peanut butter
45g/1¾oz good-quality dark chocolate, minimum 65% cocoa solids
100g/3½oz caster sugar
2 medium free-range eggs
35g/1¼oz plain flour

For the banana ice cream

4 bananas, peeled, chopped and frozen
100g/3½oz crème fraîche

To serve

75g/2¾oz toasted peanuts, chopped




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas Mark 4.


Melt the butter, peanut butter and chocolate in a medium saucepan. Remove from the heat and whisk in the sugar, eggs and flour.


Transfer the mixture to a bowl and leave to cool. Place in the fridge to rest for 10 minutes.


Meanwhile, line 4 silver rings (7cm/2¾in diameter and 5cm/2in deep) with baking paper and place on a lined baking tray.


Pour the fondant mixture into a large piping bag and pipe the mixture into the rings (alternatively spoon in). Bake for 8-10 minutes.


Meanwhile, for the ice cream, put the bananas in a blender and blitz until smooth. Add the crème fraîche and blend until smooth.


Carefully transfer the fondants to serving plates using a spatula, then remove the rings and paper. Serve with a good dollop of the ice cream alongside and scatter over the toasted peanuts.




Recipe Tips
If you don't have silver rings, the fondants can be made with ramekins greased with butter and dusted with flour.
