Ingredients
For the banana fritters

500ml/18fl oz vegetable oil, for deep frying
100g/3½oz self-raising flour
1 tsp baking powder
3 tbsp sparkling mineral water
3 bananas, peeled and halved lengthways

For the chocolate sauce

2 tbsp cocoa powder
50ml/2fl oz hot water
1 tbsp caster sugar




Method


Place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


For the banana fritters, place the flour, baking powder and water into a bowl and whisk together to make a smooth batter.


Dip the banana pieces into the batter to coat, shaking off any excess. Carefully place the banana pieces into the hot oil and deep fry for 3-4 minutes, until crisp and golden-brown. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


For the chocolate sauce, place all the chocolate sauce ingredients into a small pan over a low heat and whisk together until smooth.


To serve, place the banana fritters into a serving dish with the sauce in a small bowl alongside.
