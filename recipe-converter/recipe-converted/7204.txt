Ingredients
For the salsa

½ mango, chopped
1 tomato, chopped
pinch dried chilli flakes
handful fresh mint, chopped

For the roasted spring onions

4 spring onions
1 tbsp olive oil

For the rösti

½ sweet potato, grated
2 tbsp Greek-style yoghurt
1 free-range egg yolk
1 tbsp olive oil
½ salmon steak




Method


For the salsa, purée half the chopped mango and add to the remaining mango flesh. Add the tomato, chilli flakes and mint.


Heat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7. Place the spring onions in a baking tray dressed in the oil. Bake for ten minutes.


To make the rösti, mix the potato, yoghurt and egg yolk.


Heat the oil in a frying pan and flatten the potato mix into a ring mould in the pan. Fry for 4-5 minutes. Remove ring and fry on other side until golden.


Meanwhile, in another pan heat a drizzle of olive oil. Pan-fry the salmon placed skin-side down for 2-3 minutes each side.


Serve the salsa on top of the rösti, topped with the spring onions and salmon steak.
