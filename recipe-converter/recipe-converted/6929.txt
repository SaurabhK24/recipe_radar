Ingredients

8-10lb/3.6-4.5kg lamb ribs

For the marinade

1 litre/1 pint 15fl oz cola
85g tomato ketchup
2 tbsp black peppercorns, crushed in a mortar and pestle
1 tbsp cayenne pepper (optional)
350ml/12fl oz bourbon whiskey
165ml/6fl oz maple syrup (or 6 tbsp brown sugar)
3-4 tbsp soy sauce
2 bay leaves
4 large rosemary sprigs
4-5 garlic cloves, crushed or pounded in a mortar and pestle




Method


For the marinade, combine all the ingredients in a large bowl or basin and immerse the ribs in them. Cover with cling film and leave overnight in the fridge, if possible, otherwise marinate for an hour in the fridge.


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Baste the ribs with the marinade and cover them with aluminium foil. Precook them in the oven for 20-30 minutes. Otherwise the sweet ingredients (cola and maple syrup) may char on the barbecue.


Prepare the barbecue. It should not be too hot - the coals should be grey and ashen, but still have good heat.


Place the ribs on the barbecue. Turn them over after about 40 minutes to give the other side some texture. After about 10 minutes, turn the ribs over again.


If you like your ribs slightly crisper put them under a preheated grill for about five minutes. Be careful not to burn them. Serve.
