Ingredients
For the pasta

200g/7oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting
pinch salt
2 free-range eggs
1 tsp olive oil

For the filling

2 tbsp olive oil
¼ butternut squash, peeled and chopped
2 garlic cloves, crushed
2 baby courgettes, chopped
5 cherry tomatoes, halved
2 tbsp chopped fresh sage
100ml/3½fl oz double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the herb paste

2 handfuls fresh basil
2 handfuls fresh parsley
1 garlic clove, crushed
at least 4 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the pasta, place all of the pasta ingredients together into a food processor and pulse until the mixture comes together to form a dough. Tip out onto a floured surface and knead into a ball, then wrap in cling film and allow to rest in the fridge for 5-10 minutes.


Roll out the pasta dough as thin as possible, then cut into 5cm/2in squares with a sharp knife. Boil the pasta squares in boiling salted water, or until al dente, then drain.


For the filling, heat the olive oil in a pan and fry the butternut squash and garlic for 2-3 minutes, then add the courgettes and tomatoes and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Stir in the sage and cream, and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Simmer for 6-8 minutes, or until the squash is tender.


For the herb paste, pulse all of the pesto ingredients together in a food processor until smooth, adding more oil if necessary.


Place the pasta squares onto a serving plate and spoon the squash filling into the middle of each square. Spoon the pesto around the edges of the plate and serve.
