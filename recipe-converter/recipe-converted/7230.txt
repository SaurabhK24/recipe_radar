These are quick to make and best made on the day, but can be made up to six hours ahead and kept in the fridge.

Ingredients

8 slices Parma ham
8-10 tsp soft goats’ cheese
1 x 70g/2½oz bag rocket
salt and freshly ground black pepper
8 cucumber dill spears, each spear cut in half lengthways




Method


Lay each piece of Parma ham on a board, cut off any surplus fat and discard.


Spread a good teaspoon of goats’ cheese over the end quarter. Season with salt and pepper. Take a small handful of rocket and lay on top, leaving some of the rocket sticking out of the ends. Lay one piece of cucumber on top.


Roll the Parma ham up into a cigar shape and transfer to the fridge until needed.


Slice each roll in half and arrange standing up on the cut side on a serving platter. Serve cold.




Recipe Tips
Cucumber dill spears can be found in jars by the gherkins in the supermarket.
