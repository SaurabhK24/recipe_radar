Ingredients

2 free-range eggs
55ml/2fl oz double cream
55g/2oz caster sugar
½ tsp cinnamon
½ tsp mixed spice
4 ready-made crumpets
15g/½oz butter

For the sauce

½ tin mandarins, drained, syrup reserved
1 tbsp white wine vinegar
½ tbsp caster sugar
55ml/2fl oz double cream
zest of 1 orange
fresh mint leaves, to garnish




Method


Whisk together the eggs, cream, sugar, cinnamon and mixed spice. Dip the crumpets into the mixture to coat.


Melt the butter in a non stick frying pan and fry the crumpets, drizzling over extra mixture, if needed, for 1-2 minutes per side, until golden.


For the sauce, place the mandarins and syrup with the white wine vinegar and sugar into a saucepan and boil to reduce for 2-3 minutes.


Whip the cream and fold through the orange zest.


To serve, place two crumpets on each of two plates, top with a dollop of the orange cream and drizzle over the syrup to finish.
