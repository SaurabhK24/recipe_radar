Ingredients

vegetable oil, for deep frying
2 flour tortillas, cut into small triangles
200g/7¼oz Greek yoghurt
handful of parsley, chopped
squeeze of lemon juice




Method


Fill a pan one-third-full with vegetable oil and heat to 180C/350F. The oil is ready when you drop a breadcrumb in and it sizzles. (CAUTION: hot oil is dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Deep fry the tortilla triangles in the hot oil for 1-2 minutes, until crisp and golden. Remove using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


For the dip, mix the yoghurt, parsley and lemon juice in a bowl to combine.


To serve, arrange the tortillas on a serving plate and serve the lemon dip on the side.
