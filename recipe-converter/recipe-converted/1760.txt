Ingredients
For the salad

1 apple, cored and cut into 1cm/½in rounds
1 tbsp icing sugar
30g/1oz butter, melted
85g/3oz bacon, chopped
1 thick slice white bread, cut into cubes
2 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
handful each fresh parsley, coriander and basil, leaves torn

For the vinaigrette

2 tsp wholegrain mustard
1 tbsp red wine vinegar
3 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 free-range egg, poached, to serve




Method


For the salad, dust the apple rings with icing sugar and drizzle with melted butter. Heat a griddle pan and griddle the apple rings for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until lightly charred and softened.


Place the bacon pieces into a frying pan and fry until crisp, then remove from the pan and set aside. Add the cubed bread, olive oil and seasoning to the pan and fry for five minutes, or until crisp.


Place the bacon and croutons into a bowl with the herbs and mix well.


For the dressing, mix all the dressing ingredients together in a bowl. Pour over the salad and mix well.


To serve, place the chargrilled apples onto a plate, top with the dressed salad and finish with a poached egg.
