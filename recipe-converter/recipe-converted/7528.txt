Ingredients
For the bruschetta

2 slices white crusty bread
4 tbsp olive oil

For the peppered goats' cheese

100g/3½oz round goats' cheese
1 tbsp crushed peppercorns

For the hot tomato dressing

½ beef tomato, diced
½ tsp chilli flakes
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar

For garnish

small handful each fresh basil and coriander leaves




Method


Brush the bread with half of the oil. Toast the bread on a hot griddle pan.


Slice the goats' cheese in half to make two discs and coat in the crushed peppercorns. Griddle in the pan for about one minute on each side until just melted and golden-brown.


Place the tomato, chilli flakes, remaining oil and vinegar together in a small saucepan and heat through, stirring well. Turn off the heat and leave to one side.


Arrange the basil and coriander on two plates. Place a slice of bruschetta on the side and place the goats' cheese on top. Pour over the hot tomato dressing and serve immediately.
