Ingredients

2 slices white crusty bread
olive oil, for drizzling
55g/2oz soft white cheese with herbs, plus extra for garnish
150g/5½oz black olives, stones removed
2 cloves garlic
freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the grill to medium.


Brush the bread with a little olive oil, then toast in a hot frying pan for two minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown and crisp.


Spread the cheese over each slice of toasted bread, then place under the grill for 1-2 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and golden-brown.


Place the olives, garlic, freshly ground black pepper and a little olive oil into a mini food processor and pulse to a coarse paste. Slowly add a little more olive oil, continuing to blend, until the mixture comes together to form a smooth paste.


To serve, spread a little of the olive tapenade over each slice of toast and dot with a bit more cheese. Serve immediately.
