This feeds a lot of people. If you are using a domestic oven you will have to use four roasting tins and cook in two batches.



Ingredients

20 free-range eggs
1.25kg/2lb 12oz plain flour
500ml/18fl oz whole milk
1.5 litres/2 pints 14fl oz cold water
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
300g/10Â½oz lard
40 pork sausages




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Place the eggs, flour, milk, water and seasoning in a large mixer and whisk until you have a smooth batter. Place in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes.


Put the lard in two large roasting tins and place in the oven for 5-8 minutes or until it is smoking.


Carefully pour in the batter - it will sizzle softly in the hot fat - then arrange the sausages in the batter.


Transfer the tins back to the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes until puffed and golden-brown.
