Ingredients
For the sweet pastry

225g/8oz plain flour
110g/4oz caster sugar
110g/4oz butter
4 egg yolks

For the pecan filling

3 eggs
110g/4oz sugar
4 tablespoons golden syrup
2 tbsp rum
50g/2oz butter, melted
a pinch of salt
a few drops vanilla extract
175g/6oz pecan halves




Method


Make the pastry by putting all the ingredients into a food processor and whizzing until you get a dough.


Remove and place in a plastic bag and put into the fridge to relax for 1 hour.


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Line a 9in/23cm pie tin with the pastry.


Break the eggs in a large mixing bowl and beat well and then beat in the sugar. Add the remaining ingredients and mix well.


Pour the mixture into the pastry case and bake for 10 minutes and then reduce the oven heat to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and bake for another 30 minutes or until the top of the pie is golden. Check if it s cooked through by inserting a skewer, it s done if it comes out clean.


Turn out of the tin when slightly cooled and serve warm or cold with vanilla ice cream or a spoonful of crème fraiche.
