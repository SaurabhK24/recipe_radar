Ingredients

150ml/¼ pint double cream
100g/3½oz cheddar cheese, grated
2 free-range eggs, separated
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives
salt and freshly ground black pepper
butter, for greasing




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and place a baking sheet into the oven.


Pour the cream into a small saucepan over a low heat. Stir in the cheese and egg yolks and whisk together until slightly thickened. Remove from the heat and leave to cool for five minutes.


In a separate, clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed.


Fold the egg whites into the cream mixture. Stir in the chives and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Grease two small ramekins and pour in the soufflé mixture until the ramekins are three-quarters full.


Place the ramekins onto the preheated baking tray, transfer to the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes, or until well risen and golden-brown on top. Serve immediately in the ramekins.
