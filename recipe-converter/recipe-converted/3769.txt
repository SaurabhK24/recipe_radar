Ingredients
For the filling

2 large cooking apples (about 500g/1lb2oz in total)
1 tbsp lemon juice
2 tbsp water
20g/¾oz butter
2 tbsp caster sugar

For the topping

75g/3oz butter
100g/3½oz caster sugar
100g/3½oz self-raising flour
2 free-range eggs, lightly beaten
1 tbsp boiling water

To serve

cream or custard




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350/Gas 4.


Peel, core and roughly chop the apples.


Add the apples to a saucepan with the lemon juice and water.


Stir, cover and cook briskly for five minutes until the apples are soft.


Add the butter and caster sugar and stir.


Transfer to a 900ml/1½ pint capacity ceramic gratin dish, about 5cm/2in deep.


Leave to cool while you prepare the topping.


For the topping, cream together the butter and caster sugar until fluffy and light.


Fold the flour and egg in alternate spoonfuls into the sugar mixture until blended, being careful to keep folding rather than stirring energetically - this will keep air in the mixture and fold in.


Add a spoonful of boiling water to the mix.


Spoon the mixture over the apples. Cook in the oven for 30-35 minutes or until the topping is puffy and golden. Serve with cream or custard.
