Ingredients

150ml/5fl oz red wine
110g/4oz caster sugar

Method


Heat the red wine and sugar in a pan until just simmering.


Add the pear and poach gently for up to 20 minutes or longer if time allows, until the pear is soft. Remove pear.


To serve, reduce the poaching liquor until slightly thickened to form a sauce. Spoon the sauce into a serving bowl and stand the pear upright on it.
