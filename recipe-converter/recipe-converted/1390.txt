Ingredients
For the toasted bread

4 tbsp olive oil
2 slices ciabatta bread
½ tsp sea salt
1 clove garlic, peeled and halved

For the tomato topping

2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley, chopped
2 vine tomatoes, de-seeded and chopped
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
6 basil leaves, torn
3 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the toasted bread, drizzle the oil over the ciabatta and sprinkle over the salt. Heat a griddle pan until smoking and chargrill the bread for 2-4 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown and toasted. Remove from the pan and rub each slice of toast with the cut-side of half a garlic clove.


For the tomato topping, combine all the ingredients in a bowl and mix well, then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, pile the tomato mixture on top of the toasted bread.
