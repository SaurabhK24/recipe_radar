Ingredients

150g/5½oz white hard almond nougat
150g/5½oz plain chocolate
4 eggs, separated
150g/5½oz caster sugar
pinch of salt
500ml/17½fl oz whipped cream
6 tbsp brandy (1 tbsp for each portion)
chocolate sauce, to decorate




Method


With the help of a sharp knife, chop the nougat and the chocolate into small chunks and mix them together.


In a large bowl, mix the egg yolks with the caster sugar until pale.


In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites with the salt until firm.


Mix the whipped cream in with the egg yolks, and gently fold in the egg whites.


Place one tablespoon of the nougat and chocolate mixture on the bottom of each of six pudding moulds, approximately 6cm (2½in) diameter and 8cm (3¼in) tall.


Press down firmly and then pour one tablespoon of brandy on top of each.


Top each with some of the cream mixture.


Repeat the process and then top each with a final layer of the nougat and chocolate mixture.


Cover each mould with cling film and place in the fridge, allowing to rest for approximately one hour.


Decorate six plates with drizzles of chocolate sauce, gently remove the cling film and turn the moulds upside-down in the middle of each plate.


Lift off the moulds gently and serve immediately.
