Ingredients
For the fishcakes

½ red chill, seeds removed, roughly chopped
1 garlic clove, roughly chopped
5 tbsp fresh coriander leaves
2 tbsp cashew nuts
100g/3½oz salmon fillet
plain flour, for dusting
2-3 tbsp sesame oil

For the salad

150ml/5fl oz vegetable oil
55g/2oz thin rice noodles
100g/3½oz mangetout, chopped in half lengthways
½ red chilli, seeds removed and finely chopped
½ garlic clove, finely chopped
1 handful fresh mint leaves, roughly chopped
1 handful fresh coriander, roughly chopped




Method


For the fishcakes, place all of the fishcake ingredients, except the flour and sesame oil, into a food processor and blend to a coarse paste. Remove the fishcake mixture from the blender and divide and shape into four fishcakes of equal size and dust with flour.


Heat the sesame oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the fishcakes and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden-brown and cooked through.


For the salad, heat the vegetable oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Carefully add the rice noodles into the hot oil and fry until crisp and golden. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain onto kitchen paper.


Place the mangetout, chilli, garlic, mint and coriander into a bowl and mix well.


To serve, divide the salad between two plates. Place a handful of crisp noodles on top of each and add two fishcakes to each.
