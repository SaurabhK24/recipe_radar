25ml/1 fl oz milk
1 tsp vanilla essence
pinch cinnamon
3 tbsp butter
½ mango, sliced
100g/3½oz Greek-style yogurt
3 tbsp honey




Method


For the scones, mix the flour with the eggs and whisk.


Add the milk, vanilla essence and cinnamon. This should form a thick batter.


In a griddle pan melt the butter and add the pancake mix in large spoonfuls.


The mixture should make five pancakes.


Cook the pancakes for a minute on each side.


Place the mango onto the hot griddle pan and cook for three minutes until golden.


In a bowl mix the Greek-style yogurt and honey together.


Serve the scones with the griddled mango and spoon over the yogurt mix.
