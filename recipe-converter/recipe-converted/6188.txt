Making your own croûtons is a great way of using up stale bread. They are perfect in this simple Caesar salad.

Ingredients

3 tbsp olive oil
2 slices of day-old white bread, crusts removed, cubed
1 romaine lettuce heart, sliced
30g/1oz Parmesan cheese, shaved
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the dressing

6 tbsp light mayonnaise
1½ tbsp Dijon mustard
2 tbsp grated Parmesan cheese
½ garlic clove, crushed
a few drops of Worcestershire sauce




Method


Heat the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan, add the bread and fry over a high heat for 3–4 minutes until golden-brown. Remove with a slotted spoon, transfer to a bowl and season with salt and pepper.


Put all the dressing ingredients in a bowl and beat together until smooth with 1–2 tablespoons water.


Toss the romaine lettuce in the dressing and scatter with the toasted croûtons and grated Parmesan.




Recipe Tips
The croûtons can be made in advance and stored in an airtight container for 2 days. The dressing will keep for 2–3 days in a sealed container in the fridge.
