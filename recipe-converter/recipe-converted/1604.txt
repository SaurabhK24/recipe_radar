50ml/2fl oz water
½ tsp cracked black pepper

115ml/4fl oz rum

Method


For the caramelised pineapple, cut the centre core out of the pineapple. Heat a frying pan until hot and place the pineapple into the pan.


Fry the pineapple on each side for 1-1½ minutes until just beginning to go brown. Remove the pineapple from the pan and place on a plate. Set aside.


Add the rum to the pan and carefully tip the pan towards the flame of the hob, so that the alcohol catches alight. When the flame has subsided, add the sugar and water and cook until a caramel colour and slightly thickened. Add the black pepper and then set aside.


For the rum and raisin ice cream, place the raisins into a small saucepan and pour over the rum. Place on the heat to warm. Remove from the heat and set aside for 15 minutes for the raisins to plump up.


Place the egg yolks and sugar into a bowl and whisk together until combined.


Place the milk into a saucepan and bring to the boil. Pour the boiling milk onto the egg yolks and whisk well, then pour back into the saucepan and return to the heat.


Add the cream, rum and soaked raisins and continue to cook, over a low heat, until thickened, but do not boil. Cool and then transfer the custard to an ice cream machine to churn (according to manufacturer's instructions).


For the oven-dried pineapple, heat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Place the pineapple slices onto a baking tray and place in the oven.


Bake for 20 minutes and then turn off the heat. Leave in the oven for 1-1½ hours, turning once.


Remove the pineapple from the oven and place onto a cooling rack to firm up.


To serve, place three slices of cooked pineapple onto the plate, overlapping. Top with a spoonful of ice cream and place the oven-dried pineapple on top of the ice cream. Drizzle the sauce over the top and serve immediately.
