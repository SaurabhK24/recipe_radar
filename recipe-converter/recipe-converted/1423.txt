People from Durban are very proud of their Bunny Chow and its heritage - a cheap curry from the depression era.
  The version here is made with meat, but you can substitute with red and white kidney beans.

Ingredients

2 tbsp vegetable oil
½ tsp cumin seeds
½ tsp fennel seeds
2.5cm/1in piece of cinnamon stick
2 green cardamom pods
1 star anise
1 bay leaf
1 onion, finely chopped
2 tbsp South African curry powder
2 tomatoes, chopped
1kg/2lb 2oz boneless leg of lamb, cut into 1.5cm/½in dices
1 tbsp finely chopped fresh ginger
1 tbsp finely chopped garlic
10-12 curry leaves
2 large potatoes, cut in cubes the same size as the meat
salt
2 tbsp finely chopped coriander leaves
2 tbsp lime juice
2 loaves of crusty white bread, unsliced, each cut across in half in the middle and most of the crumbs removed
coriander cress or sprigs, to garnish




Method


Heat the oil in a pan and sauté the whole spices and bay leaf until the spices sizzle.


Add the onion and cook for 5–7 minutes until translucent.


Stir in the curry powder and sauté for one minute, then add the tomatoes and stir to mix.


Cook on medium heat, stirring often, until you get a sauce-like consistency.


Add the meat, ginger, garlic and curry leaves and 300ml/11fl oz water, bring to the boil then reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 40-50 minutes or until the meat is tender.


Add the potatoes, salt to taste and 200ml/7fl oz water. Continue simmering until the meat and potatoes are perfectly cooked (about 15 minutes).


Stir in the chopped coriander and lime juice.


To serve, spoon into the hollows in the bread and garnish with coriander cress.
