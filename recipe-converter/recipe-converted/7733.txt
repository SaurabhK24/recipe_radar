This is a cheat’s variation of the classic French tart and makes an impressive pudding to serve in the autumn with lots of cream or ice cream.

  Equipment and preparation: you will need a 20cm/8in round fixed base deep sponge tin at least 5cm/2in deep.

Ingredients

about 75g/3oz light muscovado sugar
about 9 ripe large plums, halved and stones removed
100g/3½oz marzipan
1 x 320g/11½oz pack all-butter puff pastry
ice cream, cream or crème fraîche, to serve (optional)




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7 (200C fan).


Sprinkle the sugar over the base of the cake tin in an even layer.


Arrange the plums on top of the sugar, cut-side down.


Roll out the marzipan thinly to a round slightly smaller than the tin and place on top of the plums.


Roll out the pastry just a little bit bigger so that it is the width of the cake tin. Cut around the tin to make a circle, lay the pastry over the plums and tuck the edges of the pastry down around the fruit. Make a small cross in the top of the pastry to let the steam out.


Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is crisp and golden-brown and the plums are tender.


Loosen the edges of the tart, then turn out onto a plate and serve with ice cream, cream or crème fraîche.




Recipe Tips
Don’t be tempted to use a loose-bottom cake tin or a springform tin as you will lose all the juices. It is a good idea to bake the tart on a baking tray in case the juices run out.
