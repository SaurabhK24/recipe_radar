Fruit fritters can be served for breakfast or as an after-school snack. Kids can mix the batter and add vegetables or fruits but it is best for an adult to fry the fritters as they get very hot.






By Jo Ingleby






Ingredients

200g/7oz self-raising flour (white or wholemeal)
2 free-range eggs
150ml/5fl oz milk
1 tbsp butter, for cooking
2 bananas, sliced or 2 large apples, cored and sliced into 1cm/½in rings or a handful of frozen soft fruits (or a mixture)
½ tsp cinnamon
2 tsp caster sugar




Method


Kid’s job: Sift the flour into a large bowl.


Kid’s job: Knock the egg gently on the work surface to crack it – cracking on a flat surface will create less little bits of shell. Pull the egg open over a small bowl. Pull out any bits of shell that have fallen into the bowl. (Wash your hands after handling eggs.)


Kid’s job: Add the eggs and a little bit of the milk to the sifted flour and stir with a whisk or fork. Add the rest of the milk bit by bit, mixing as much as you can to get rid of any lumps. Leave the mixture to stand for a few minutes.


Kid’s job: Gently stir in the fruit that you want to use. Dip the apple rings into the batter so they are coated on both sides. Be careful – they are fragile!


Adult’s job: Melt a teaspoon of butter in a frying pan over a medium heat.


Adult’s job: Carefully drop four large spoonfuls of the fritter batter onto the frying pan making sure you leave space around each spoonful as the fritters with spread as they cook. Apple rings will make one fritter each.


Adult’s job: Cook for 3-4 minutes on one side. You should see bubbles forming and the mixture should begin to set around the edges.


Adult’s job: Carefully flip over the fritters and cook on the other side until they are golden-brown and cooked through this should take another 3-4 minutes. Repeat until you have used all of the batter mix, adding a little more butter each time you add more fritters to the pan.


Kid’s job: While the fritters are cooking, mix the cinnamon and sugar together in a small bowl. Sprinkle the cooked fritters with cinnamon sugar and tuck in.
