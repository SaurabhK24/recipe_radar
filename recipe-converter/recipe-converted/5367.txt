Jerusalem artichokes have a wonderful texture, with an earthy, slightly nutty flavour. Here they blend perfectly with the luxury of the white truffle oil.

Ingredients

30g/1oz butter
70g/2½oz onions, sliced
250ml/9fl oz chicken stock
400g/14oz Jerusalem artichokes, peeled and cut into small pieces
1 bouquet garni
250g/9oz butter
few drops white truffle oil
few drops truffle juice (optional)
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the onions and a pinch of salt and cook gently until soft, without colouring. Add 250ml/9fl oz water, the chicken stock, artichokes and bouquet garni and bring to the boil. Cook for about 20 minutes. Once the artichokes are soft, remove the bouquet garni. Transfer to a blender and blend to a fine purée, then pass through a fine sieve.


Whisk the butter into the soup, add a few drops of white truffle oil and some truffle juice (if using), then season with salt and pepper.


Serve with a sprinkling of fresh chives.
