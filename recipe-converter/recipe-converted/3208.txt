Ingredients

110g/4oz plain flour
pinch salt
1 free-range egg
1 free-range egg yolk
300ml/½ pint milk
1 tbsp vegetable oil

To serve

55g/2oz raspberries
150ml/¼ pint double cream, whipped




Method


Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the middle of the flour.


Add the egg, egg yolk and milk to the well in the flour and whisk until the batter is smooth. Leave to rest for a few minutes.


Heat a flat griddle or frying pan and rub with vegetable oil. Pour a ladleful of batter into the pan and swirl to coat the base. Cook for 1-2 minutes, then flip and cook on the other side for one minute.


Place the pancake on a plate and repeat with the rest of the batter.


To serve, fold each pancake into four. Place onto serving plates and serve with raspberries and whipped cream.
