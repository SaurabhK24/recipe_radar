This belly pork takes no time to cook on the barbecue, but an overnight preparation gets you an aromatic marinated flavour and lots of perfect crackling.

Ingredients

1.5kg/3lb5oz belly of pork
3 tbsp sea salt
2 star anise, ground
1 large orange, zest only
2 fresh bay leaves
8 garlic cloves
1 tbsp Sichuan peppercorns
Â½ tsp Chinese five-spice powder
200ml/7fl oz olive oil
2 tbsp sesame oil




Method


Make sure you or your butcher score the pork skin well (using a small, sharp kitchen knife or a clean DIY knife) - nice fine scores make better crackling. Mix the salt, ground star anise and the orange zest together and rub well into the skin, making sure the salt goes into all the cuts of the pork rind.


Using a mini-blender or a pestle and mortar, add the bay leaves, garlic, Szechuan peppercorns, five spice and blend to a paste, then slowly add the olive oil while mixing.


Leave the pork to dry overnight in the fridge; do not cover as you want it to dry.


Heat a barbecue or griddle and slice the pork into thin slices. Place the pork slices onto the hot griddle or barbeque and brush with the marinade. Cook each side for a few minutes, or until cooked through and the skin is crisp.
