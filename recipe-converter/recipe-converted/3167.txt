Ingredients

1 tbsp butter
½ leek, finely sliced
¼ tsp cayenne pepper
5 tbsp double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper
100g/3½oz cheddar, grated




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Heat the butter in a small saucepan and sauté the leeks for 3-4 minutes, or until soft.


Add the cayenne pepper and double cream and simmer for 3-4 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and spoon into a small ovenproof dish.


Sprinkle over the grated cheese, then transfer to the oven and bake for five minutes, or until the cheese is melted and golden. Serve immediately.
