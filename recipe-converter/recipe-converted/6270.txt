Small dollops of fruit jam add an extra touch of sweetness to these moreish French butter cookies.

From MasterChef






Ingredients

250g/9oz plain flour
200g/7oz butter, cut into small cubes
100g/3½oz icing sugar
pinch of salt
2 free-range egg yolks
4 tbsp raspberry jam
4 tbsp apricot jam




Method


Preheat the oven to 170C/325F/Gas 3.


Place the flour, butter, icing sugar and salt into a bowl. Using your fingertips, rub the ingredients together until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.


Add the egg yolks and mix until a dough forms. Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and roll out to a thickness of about 0.5cm/¼in. Cut out shapes using a 4cm/1½in cutter.


Divide the sables in half. Using a 2cm/1in fluted cutter, make a hole in the middle of half of the sable biscuits and discard the dough. Place all the sables on a baking tray.


Bake the sables for 10-12 minutes, or until light golden-brown and crisp. Remove and transfer to a wire rack to cool.


Using a teaspoon, place a small dollop of raspberry jam on a whole sable. Place a sable (with a hole) over the whole sable biscuit. Repeat until half the sables are done with raspberry jam, then repeat the process, using apricot jam, for the remaining sables.
