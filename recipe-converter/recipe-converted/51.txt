Ingredients
For the risotto

1 tbsp olive oil
30g/1oz butter
½ onion, finely diced
1 corn on the cob, or a small can of unsweetened sweetcorn, drained
250g/9oz quick cook basmati rice
100ml/3½fl oz white wine
2 tbsp double cream
2 tbsp cheddar, grated
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the pesto

large handful fresh basil leaves
1 clove garlic, chopped
2 tbsp cheddar cheese, grated
3 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
fresh coriander leaves, to garnish (optional)




Method


For the risotto, heat the olive oil and butter in a frying pan, add the onion and gently fry for 3-4 minutes or until softened but not coloured.


Place the corn on the cob (cut end down) on the work surface and cut the kernels from the cob with a sharp knife.


Add the corn kernels to the frying pan and fry for two minutes. Add the quick cook rice to the pan, stir well to coat all the grains in the oil and gently fry for two minutes.


Add the wine and leave to bubble for 1-2 minutes, or until just cooked. Add the cream and cheese and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Stir well and spoon into a serving bowl.


For the pesto, put the basil leaves, garlic, cheddar cheese and olive oil into a small blender and blend until almost smooth. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, top the risotto with a spoonful of pesto and garnish with coriander leaves if you like.
