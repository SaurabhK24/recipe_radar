Ingredients

300g/10½oz butternut squash, peeled and chopped
olive oil, for drizzling
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 garlic cloves, unpeeled
½ onion, chopped
300ml/½ pint hot chicken or vegetable stock
100ml/3½fl oz double cream
chopped fresh parsley, to garnish




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Place the butternut squash onto a baking tray. Drizzle with olive oil, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and scatter over the garlic cloves. Place in the oven and roast for 10-15 minutes, or until tender and golden-brown. Set aside.


Meanwhile, heat a dash of olive oil in a saucepan, add the onion and fry for five minutes over a gentle heat, or until softened.


Add the butternut squash to the onions (reserving a few cubes for garnish). Squeeze the roasted garlic out of its skin and add to the pan. Add the chicken stock and simmer for three minutes.


Stir in the cream and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Blend with a hand blender until smooth. Pour into a bowl and garnish with the reserved roasted butternut squash cubes and chopped parsley. Serve.
