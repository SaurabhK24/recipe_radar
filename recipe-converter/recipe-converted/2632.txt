A great way to brush up the humble carrot. Star anise adds a touch of Christmas spice to the sweet buttery glaze.






By Tom Kerridge


From Tom Kerridge Cooks Christmas






Ingredients

9 medium carrots, peeled, topped and tailed
250g/9oz butter
150g/5½oz sugar
3 tsp salt
4 star anise




Method


Use a clean scourer to smooth the carrots and remove any peel marks (optional).


In a pan combine 400ml/14fl oz of water, the butter, sugar, salt and star anise. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and add the carrots. Cook until the carrots are tender (approximately 45 minutes) and the volume of liquid has reduced by half.


Serve the carrots as a side dish with the reduced cooking liquid poured over.




Recipe Tips
The carrots can be cooked in advance and quickly reheated in the cooking liquor just before serving.
