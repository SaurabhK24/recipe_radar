Ingredients
For the cake

1 free-range egg
55g/2oz butter, softened, plus extra for greasing
55g/2oz self-raising flour
55g/2oz caster sugar
1 orange, zest only
2 carrots, peeled and grated

For the icing

200ml/7fl oz Greek-style yoghurt
3 tbsp icing sugar
1 orange, zest only
sprig fresh mint, to garnish




Method


For the cake, place all of the cake ingredients into a food processor and blend briefly until well combined - don't overmix.


Grease a 600ml/1 pint pudding basin with softened butter. Spoon the mixture into the basin and smooth the top with a wet palette knife.


Cover with cling film and microwave on high for 6-7 minutes, or until well risen and springy to the touch.


Leave to cool, then loosen the edges and turn out onto a plate.


For the icing, mix the yoghurt, icing sugar and orange zest together in a bowl.


To serve, drizzle the icing over the cake and garnish with mint.
