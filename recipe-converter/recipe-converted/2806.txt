110g/4oz unsalted butter, softened
300ml/10fl oz full-fat milk
300ml/10fl oz double cream
1 drop vanilla extract
1 tsp ground cinnamon
20g/1oz cocoa powder
5 free-range eggs
100g/3½oz caster sugar

For the butterscotch roasted pears

100g/3½oz caster sugar
100g/3½oz unsalted butter
100ml/3½fl oz double cream
2 pears, core removed and sliced

For the Chantilly cream

200ml/7fl oz double cream
25g/1oz icing sugar
1 drop vanilla extract

For the chocolate sauce

50g/2oz cocoa powder
100ml/3½fl oz water
2 tsp double cream




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the cocoa bread and butter pudding, remove all the crusts from the bread and spread one side of each slice with butter. Cut into triangles and lay them, overlapping, in the bottom of an ovenproof dish lightly greased with butter.


Place the milk, cream, vanilla, cinnamon and cocoa powder in a large saucepan and warm through.


Put the eggs and sugar in a large bowl and whisk until pale and doubled in size.


Gradually add the liquid to the eggs whisking all the time. Pour back in to the pan and gently cook until the custard is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.


Pour the custard mixture over the bread and leave to sit for 30 minutes, then bake in the oven for 20-30 minutes.


For the butterscotch roasted pears, place the sugar and butter in a medium frying pan and heat until melted.


Add the cream and cook for 3-4 minutes, then add the pears and cook for a further 10 minutes.


To make the Chantilly cream put in the cream, icing sugar and vanilla extract in a large bowl and whisk until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed.


For the chocolate sauce, place the cocoa and water in a small saucepan and cook until it thickens. Add the cream.


To serve, place a square of the pudding in bowl, pour over the sauce and top with a spoonful of the cream.
