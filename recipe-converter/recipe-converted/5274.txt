Ingredients

1 mango, cut in half, flesh scored, turned inside out
2 tbsp honey
2 pinch chilli flakes
½ tsp cinnamon
3 tbsp double cream, whipped until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Place the mango halves onto a baking sheet. Drizzle them with the honey, then sprinkle the chilli and cinnamon over them. Bake for 3-4 minutes, or until the coating is just bubbling.


To serve, place the baked mango halves onto a serving plate, and spoon the whipped cream alongside.
