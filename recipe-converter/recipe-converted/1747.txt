16 slices prosciutto
1 charentais melon
8-12 wild rocket leaves
75ml/2½fl oz virgin olive oil
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

Method


Remove the outer skin from the melon. Cut in half and remove and discard the seeds. Slice the melon thinly and arrange on the serving plate, together with the sliced prosciutto. Wash and drain the wild rocket, and sprinkle a few leaves over the top.


Using a potato peeler, shave the pecorino cheese over the salad, drizzle with olive oil and a little sea salt before serving.
