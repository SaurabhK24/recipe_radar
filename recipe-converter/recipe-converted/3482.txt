Ingredients
For the deep-fried courgettes

500ml/18fl oz vegetable oil, for deep frying
100g/3½oz plain flour
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 courgettes, sliced thinly
sea salt, for sprinkling

For the hummus

100g/3½oz tinned chickpeas, rinsed and drained
50ml/2fl oz olive oil
1 garlic clove
½ lemon, juice only
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
salt and freshly ground black pepper
sprig fresh coriander, to garnish




Method


For the deep-fried courgettes, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Place the flour onto a plate and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Coat the courgette strips in the flour, shaking off any excess.


Carefully place the courgette strips into the oil and deep fry until golden-brown. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon, drain on kitchen paper and sprinkle with salt.


For the hummus, place all the hummus ingredients into a food processor and blend until smooth. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, place the courgettes onto a plate with the hummus in a small bowl alongside and garnish with coriander.
