For the red wine sauce

Method


Soak the two wooden skewers in water for 10 minutes.


To make the kebabs, place the lamb, leek, olive oil, garlic and honey into a large bowl and mix together. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Thread the leek and lamb alternately onto a skewer.


Heat a griddle pan until smoking. Add the kebab and cook for two minutes on side, or until the lamb is cooked through.


To make the purée, place the olive oil, cauliflower, potato, mint and parsley all into a food processor, season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and blend until smooth.


In a frying pan boil the wine, honey and mint and pan and reduce until thickened.


To serve, place the kebab on a plate with the purée alongside and pour over the wine sauce.
