Ingredients

1 cucumber
75g/2½oz feta cheese, drained
1 tbsp chopped fresh dill
¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper
3 tbsp pomegranate seeds




Method


Top, tail and then peel the cucumber. Cut into 1.5-2cm/¾in thick slices to give about 16-18 in total. Using a melon baller, small teaspoon or a ¼ teaspoon measuring spoon, scoop out enough of the seeds from the middle to give a cup that has a border about 5mm thick, making sure you don’t go right down to the bottom. Arrange them on a large platter and set aside.


Break the feta cheese into a small bowl and mash it with a fork until as smooth as possible. Add the dill and season with the pepper (but no salt as feta is already salty), stirring everything together well. Divide the feta cheese mixture between the cucumber cups. Arrange a little pile of pomegranate seeds on top of each one and serve.
