Ingredients
For the mousse

200ml/7fl oz double cream
2 tbsp heather honey
2 tbsp Greek-style yoghurt
½ mango, peeled, stone removed
2 tbsp white wine

For the honeyed mango chunks

knob of butter
½ mango, peeled, stone removed, chopped

Method


For the mousse, whisk the cream in a bowl until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Gently fold in the honey and yoghurt.


Place the mango flesh into a food processor along with the wine and blend to a smooth purée. Fold the mango mixture into the cream.


For the mango chunks, melt the butter in a frying pan and add the mango and honey. Fry for 3-4 minutes, or until the mango is tender and caramelised.


To serve, place a chefs' ring on a serving plate and spoon in the mango mousse. Remove the ring, then spoon over the honeyed mango and serve immediately.
