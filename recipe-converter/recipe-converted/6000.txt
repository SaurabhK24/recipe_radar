Serve these spring rolls as a lip-smackingly good starter, or make smaller ones to serve as canapes.

Ingredients
For the rolls

1 onion, finely sliced
2 carrots, finely sliced
2 spring onions finely sliced
2 celery stalks, finely sliced
2 green chillies, finely sliced
250g/9oz squid, cleaned and finely sliced
4 fillets mackerel, chopped into small pieces
1 tbsp fish sauce
50g/1¾oz roast peanuts, chopped
1 lime, juiced
1 small knob of root ginger, peeled and grated
1 tsp sesame seeds
25g/1oz plain flour
100ml/3½fl oz warm water
10 sheets spring roll pastry
oil, for frying

For the dipping sauce

4 limes, juice only
25g/1oz sugar
2 tbsp soy sauce
50ml/2fl oz rice wine vinegar
50ml/2fl oz mirin




Method


In a hot pan or wok, flash fry the vegetables and remove them from the pan. Place the squid and mackerel in the pan and cook for 30 seconds then remove from the pan.


In a bowl, mix the hot fish and vegetables with the fish sauce, peanuts, lime juice, ginger and sesame seeds and set aside to cool.


Mix the flour into the water and stir to make a thin paste. Lay out the pastry sheets and brush each one all over with the flour paste. Divide the fish mixture into five portions, wrap each one in a sheet of pastry then wrap each roll in a second sheet of pastry.


Heat the oil to 180C/350F in a deep-fat fryer or large saucepan then fry the rolls until golden-brown and crisp. Drain the rolls on kitchen paper. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


To make the dipping sauce, mix together all the ingredients in a bowl until well combined.


Serve the rolls immediately with the dipping sauce alongside.
