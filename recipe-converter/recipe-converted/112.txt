Ingredients

170g/6oz rolled oats
170g/6oz raisins or sultanas
110g/4oz dried apricots, roughly chopped
110g /4oz hazelnuts, split in half and roasted
350ml/12fl oz fresh apple juice

1 small tub Greek or natural yoghurt
4 ripe apricots, roughly chopped
clear honey to serve




Method


In a large bowl mix together the oats, raisins, apricots and hazelnuts. Pour over the apple juice and leave for 10-15 minutes to allow the oats and dried fruit to soak up the juice.


Divide the muesli between 6 glass bowls and top with the grated apple. Spoon on a dollop of yoghurt and drizzle over some honey. Serve immediately.
