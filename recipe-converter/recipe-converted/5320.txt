Ingredients
For the tomato sauce

1 tbsp olive oil
½ onion
1 garlic clove, crushed
50ml/2fl oz white wine
½ x 400g/14oz can plum tomatoes, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the potato and sausage

1 tbsp olive oil
½ baking potato, chopped
1 vegetarian sausage, cut in half lengthways
1 sprig fresh chervil, to garnish




Method


For the tomato sauce, heat the oil in a saucepan and gently fry the onion and garlic until the onion is translucent, about 4-5 minutes.


Add the white wine and simmer for about one minute, until slightly reduced. Add the tomatoes and simmer for a further five minutes. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and remove from the heat. Process until smooth with a hand blender.


For the potato and sausage, heat the oil in a separate frying pan and fry the cubes of potato and the sausage halves until coloured and cooked through, about 7-8 minutes.


To serve, pile the potatoes and sausages onto a serving plate and pour over the tomato sauce. Garnish with chervil.
