1 tsp madras curry powder
freshly grated nutmeg
200ml/7fl oz milk
110ml/4fl oz double cream
300g/10½oz naturally smoked haddock, (NOT dyed) picked over, bones removed and flesh cut into chunks

Method


Cook the onion gently in the butter for a few minutes, then add the rice.


Continue cooking gently and stirring, adding the curry powder and nutmeg. After a few minutes, add the milk, cream and 250ml/9fl oz water.


When the mixture begins to simmer, add the fish and continue simmering, stirring occasionally until the rice is cooked. (You may need to add a little water if the mixture becomes dry.)
