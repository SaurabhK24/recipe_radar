Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
½ red onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
85g/3oz crocodile fillet, chopped
85g/3oz canned cooked chickpeas, rinsed and drained
½ beef tomato, de-seeded and chopped
1 tbsp tomato purée
2 tbsp boiling water
1 large handful spinach leaves
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tsp sesame seeds




Method


Heat the oil in a pan and lightly fry the onion and garlic for 3-4 minutes, or until softened but not coloured. Add the crocodile pieces and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until the crocodile is golden-brown all over.


Add the chickpeas, chopped tomato, tomato purée and water to the pan, stirring well. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 1-2 more minutes, or until the crocodile is cooked through, then add the spinach. Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the spinach is wilted, then season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, spoon the stew into a serving bowl and garnish with the sesame seeds.
