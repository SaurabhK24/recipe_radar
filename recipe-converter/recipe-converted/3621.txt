Ingredients

2 duck breasts
2 shallots, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
pinch of fresh thyme, finely chopped
5 cherry tomatoes, chopped in half
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
Â¼ glass of red wine
30g/1oz butter
55g/2oz redcurrants (or 3 tbsp redcurrant jelly)




Method


Slash the fat on the duck breast and then sear it on both sides in a very hot pan.


Remove it from the pan and place in the oven at 180C/350F/Gas 4 for about 10 minutes.


Meanwhile, drain off any excess fat from the frying pan. Put in the shallots, garlic, thyme and tomatoes and cook for a minute or two.


Deglaze the pan with the balsamic vinegar and red wine. Add the butter and redcurrants and reduce the sauce for a couple of minutes.


Remove the duck from the oven to rest, then slice on the diagonal. Serve with the sauce drizzled over it and some crusty French bread.
