Ingredients

8 Portobello or flat chestnut mushrooms, about 500g/1lb 2oz in total
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
low-calorie cooking spray
4 lean smoked back bacon rashers
6 large free-range eggs
1 tbsp chopped chives, plus extra to garnish
1 tbsp wholegrain mustard
knob of butter
4 large slices of sourdough bread
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.


Put the mushrooms on a foil-lined baking sheet and scatter over the garlic. Spray with a little oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Bake in the oven for 18-20 minutes or until softened. Leave until cool enough to handle.


Meanwhile, preheat the grill to medium-hot. Lay the bacon rashers on a foil-lined grill pan and cook for 5-6 minutes, or until slightly crispy. Cool slightly, then slice thickly. Leave the grill on for the frittata.


Put the eggs, chives and mustard in a bowl, beat together lightly and season with freshly ground black pepper.


Heat a large, nonstick frying pan with an ovenproof handle over a medium heat. Add the butter, when the butter is foaming pour in the egg mixture and cook for 1-2 minutes, then add the bacon and whole mushrooms, stalk side up. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes or until almost set. Place the pan under the grill and cook the frittata for 2-3 minutes, or until set. Allow to cool slightly.


Toast the bread and arrange on serving plates. Cut the frittata into wedges and serve on the toasted sourdough. Garnish with chives and serve.
