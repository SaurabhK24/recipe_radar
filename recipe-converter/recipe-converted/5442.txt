Ingredients

6 very big prawns, the biggest possible
1 can coconut milk
1 stem lemongrass
1 big lump of ginger, chopped
2 large garlic cloves, crushed
2 shallots, finely chopped
2 red chillies chopped
2 plum tomatoes, seeded and finely chopped
bunch of coriander, chopped
1 tsp garam masala
1 tsp turmeric
85-110g/3-4oz per person basmati rice, washed
5 limes, juice only
half a can of coconut milk




Method


Cook the washed basmati in half the lime juice and the coconut milk. Add enough water to make the liquid come level with the rice, and simmer for 5 minutes. Now put a lid on the pan and leave it for 15 minutes. At the end of this time it will be perfectly cooked.


Butterfly the prawns, and marinate in a little lime juice. In another pan, add the other ingredients to a little oil and cook to soften.


Then add the coconut milk and simmer and season. Add the prawns and cook for 2 minutes more. Serve with rice cooked in lime juice, coriander and coconut milk.
