Ingredients

5 tbsp plain flour
1 free-range egg
pinch of salt
3-4 tbsp milk
1 tbsp vegetable oil

For the filling

150ml/Â¼pint red wine
1 sausage




Method


For the pancake, whisk the flour, egg, salt and enough milk together in a bowl to form a smooth batter.


Heat the oil in a shallow frying pan, then wipe any excess oil away with kitchen paper.


Spoon in the batter and swirl to cover the base of the pan.


Fry until the underside of the pancake is golden, then turn over and cook the other side until golden-brown.


For the filling, place the red wine into a small saucepan and boil to reduce the liquid volume by half.


Add the sausage and enough water to cover. Simmer for 8-10 minutes, or until the sausage is cooked through.


To serve, place the pancake onto a plate. Place the sausage mixture intp the centre and fold the pancake over.
