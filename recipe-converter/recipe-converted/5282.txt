2 eggs, beaten
milk
1.4kg/3lb chicken, jointed
oil, for frying

Method


Season the flour with salt and freshly ground black pepper and combine the eggs with milk.


Dust the chicken pieces with flour then dip in the eggwash.


In a large frying pan heat the oil and fry chicken gently to begin with, raising the temperature until it is as brown and cooked after 10-15 minutes. Remove from the pan and keep warm.


For the gravy, add a little flour to the oil in the pan and brown slowly.


Add cold water, stirring until the gravy is of a required thickness, plus salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Simmer for a few minutes then pour over chicken.
