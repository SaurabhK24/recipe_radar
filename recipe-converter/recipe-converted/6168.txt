Ingredients

100g/3½oz butter, softened
75g/2½oz caster sugar
1 free-range egg, separated
1 small lemon, finely grated zest only
200g/7oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting
50g/1¾oz currants
1-2 tbsp milk
caster sugar, for dusting




Method


Preheat the oven 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Line 3 baking trays with non-stick paper.


Measure the butter and sugar into a bowl and cream until well combined and fluffy. Add the egg yolk and lemon zest. Sift in the flour and mix well to combine. Stir in the currants and enough milk to make a fairly soft dough.


Knead the dough on a floured work surface and, using a rolling pin, roll the dough until about 5mm/¼in thick. Using a 6cm/2½in round fluted cutter, cut out 24 rounds. Transfer to the baking trays using a palette knife.


Bake the biscuits for about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, lightly beat the egg white using a fork.


Remove the biscuits from the oven and brush the tops with beaten egg white. Sprinkle over the caster sugar and return to the oven for further 5 minutes, or until pale golden-brown and cooked though. Leave to cool on the trays for a few minutes, then carefully lift on to a wire rack to cool completely.




Recipe Tips
The biscuits can be made up to 3 days ahead and kept in an airtight container.


  Work quickly in a cool area of the kitchen as you do not want the dough to become too soft. If it is soft after mixing, chill the dough for about 10 minutes until easier to handle.
