Ingredients

4 tall pears with stalks
200g/7oz caster sugar
2 cinnamon sticks
water to cover

For the sauce

50g/2oz blue cheese e.g. Stilton, Roquefort, gorgonzola
50g/2oz cheddar or gruyere cheese
1 tbsp créme fraîche




Method


Place the pears upright in a saucepan so they fit snugly. Cover with cold water then remove the pears, add the sugar and cinnamon sticks to the water, and bring to the boil, stirring.


Peel the pears, leaving the stalks and trimming the base so they sit flat, and return to the pan.


Poach for 15 to 20 minutes or until tender but not too soft, and then drain. Chop the cheeses, and combine in a small pan with the créme fraîche.


Heat gently, stirring with a wooden spoon, until melted. Remove from the heat. Add a little more créme fraîche if not runny enough to pour.


Pour the hot cheese sauce over the pears, coating them well. (Don't pour too much or you'll end up with too big a puddle at the bottom).


Serve immediately.
