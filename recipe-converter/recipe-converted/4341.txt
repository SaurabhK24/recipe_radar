Glass noodles are usually made of mung bean and are therefore called mung bean thread. They are never fried but sometimes used in soups and such like. When re-hydrating just cover with cold water and leave the rest to time.

Ingredients

1 packet glass noodles
200g/7oz finely minced chicken breast
salt

For the nam jim (Thai dipping sauce)

1 lime, juice only
2 garlic cloves, peeled but left whole
3 Thai shallots, peeled
2 long red chillies, seeds removed from one
40g/1½oz palm sugar
40ml/1½fl oz fish sauce
3 coriander roots
100g/3½oz crabmeat
small handful coriander, Thai basil and mint leaves
50g/1¾oz ground roast rice (available online and in Thai groceries)
5 shallots (preferably Thai), sliced
chilli powder, to taste
1 red chilli, seeds removed, sliced




Method


Reconstitute the noodles according to the packet instructions.


Bring a saucepan of water to the boil, season with a little salt and cook the minced chicken for three minutes, or until cooked, breaking up with a whisk. Drain and allow to cool on a baking tray.


For the nam jim, use a pestle and mortar to pound the lime juice, garlic, shallots, chilli, palm sugar, fish sauce and coriander roots to make the dipping sauce.


In a large dish, combine the drained chicken, crabmeat, drained noodles, herbs and nam jim. Sprinkle with the ground roast rice, shallots, chilli powder and strips of red chilli. Serve immediately.




Recipe Tips
To make the ground roast rice, soak long grain rice for five minutes in warm water, then drain. Heat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Spread the rice thinly on a baking tray and cook in the oven for 20 minutes, or until the rice has crisped up and is a light golden-brown. Crush in a pestle and mortar.
