This healthier version of peanut brittle combines lavender from the garden with toasted, lightly salted sunflower seeds.

Ingredients

80g/2¾oz sunflower seeds
splash light soy sauce
115g/4oz unsalted butter
225g/8oz granulated sugar
100g/3½oz light brown sugar
pinch salt
1-2 tsp lavender flowers, finely chopped




Method


Heat a frying pan over a low heat. Add the sunflower seeds and dry fry for 1-2 minutes, or until toasted. Stir in the soy sauce and cook until evaporated. Remove the seeds and set aside.


Heat the butter, sugars, salt and 2 tablespoons water in a saucepan over a low heat until the butter has melted and the sugar has dissolved.


Bring the mixture to the boil, then reduce the heat to moderate and continue to cook until the temperature reaches 150C. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the lavender flowers, then set aside to cool slightly.


Pour the brittle mixture into silicone ice-cube trays, then sprinkle over the sunflower seeds. Set aside to harden, then remove from the moulds and serve.




Recipe Tips
Instead of using silicone ice-cube trays, you can spread the molten brittle mixture on a baking tray lined with silicone. Once hardened, break the brittle using a toffee hammer. Alternatively, use cake-pop moulds to create brittle lollipops.
