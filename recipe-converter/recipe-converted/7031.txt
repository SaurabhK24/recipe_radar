Surprise yourself and create this classic restaurant dish easily at home. Look for a nut-brown colour in the butter (beurre noisette) before squeezing in the lemon juice to lock in the colour and flavour.

Ingredients
For the Dover sole

2 whole Dover sole, filleted and pin boned
25g/1oz plain flour, seasoned with salt and pepper
25ml/1fl oz olive oil
50g/1¾oz unsalted butter
1 shallot, finely chopped
1 lemon, juice only
10g/ baby capers
2 tsp gentleman’s relish
2 tbsp finely chopped parsley
100g/3½oz brown shrimps

For the wilted spinach

50g/1¾oz unsalted butter
50g/1¾oz baby spinach
pinch freshly grated nutmeg

To serve

1 bunch fresh watercress
1 lemon, peeled with spoon to remove all the pith and finely sliced to resemble flowers




Method


For the Dover sole, dust the fish in the seasoned flour. Heat a large frying pan and add the oil. Once hot, add the fish skin-side down and cook for a couple of minutes. Turn over and cook for a further minute.


Remove the fish from the pan and set aside to rest.


Heat the butter in a separate frying pan, add the shallots and fry for a few minutes. One it has reached the nut brown stage (or beurre noisette), add the lemon juice, capers, gentleman’s relish, parsley and shrimps and cook for a couple of minutes.


For the wilted spinach, in the same pan you fried your fish, heat the butter, add the spinach and a tablespoon of water and cook until wilted. Finish with a grating of fresh nutmeg.


To serve, place some spinach in the centre of each serving plate and top with the fish. Spoon the sauce over and around the fish. Garnish with watercress and lemon flowers.
