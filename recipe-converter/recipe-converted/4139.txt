Ingredients

4 tbsp olive oil
110g/4oz cherry tomatoes
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the fried goats' cheese

55g/2oz slice of goats' cheese
30g/1oz plain flour
1 egg, beaten
30g/1oz brioche breadcrumbs

For the grape chutney

85g/3oz grapes, cut in half
1-2 tbsp white wine vinegar
pinch of chilli flakes
4 tbsp caster sugar




Method


Pre-heat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Heat two tablespoons of oil in a pan and fry the tomatoes for a few minutes. Season and transfer to the oven for 8-10 minutes.


Meanwhile, coat the goats' cheese in flour, dip in the egg and coat in the breadcrumbs. Repeat this process to give a second coating.


Heat two tablespoons of oil in a non-stick frying pan and fry the breaded cheese for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden.


To make the chutney, heat the grapes, vinegar, chilli flakes and sugar in a pan for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally.


Transfer the roasted tomatoes to a serving plate and the fried cheese on top. Spoon the grape chutney alongside, to serve.
