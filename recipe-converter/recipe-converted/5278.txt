This easy banana ice cream makes a great healthy dessert for children.






By James Martin


From Sweet Baby James






Ingredients

4 very ripe bananas, peeled, cut into chunks
¼ tsp vanilla essence
3-4 tbsp sugar, honey or sweetener, to taste
150ml/5fl oz buttermilk or 150g/5½oz Greek-style yoghurt




Method


Spread the banana chunks out on a tray and transfer to the freezer. Leave the banana in the freezer until frozen all the way through (about one hour).


Place the frozen banana chunks into a food processor. Add the vanilla, sugar, honey or sweetener and half of the buttermilk (or yoghurt). Turn on the processor and blend for a few moments. Then, while the processor is still running, pour in the remaining buttermilk in a thin, steady stream (if you are using yoghurt, just tip it all in and blend).


Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Serve at once.




Recipe Tips
The riper the bananas you use, the sweeter the flavour of ice cream.
