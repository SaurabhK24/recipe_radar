Ingredients
For the cheesecake

150g/5½oz ready-made shortbread biscuits, crushed
2 tbsp clear honey
150g/5½oz mascarpone
2 tbsp double cream, whipped
1 tbsp hazelnut liqueur
1 vanilla pod, seeds only
2 tbsp chopped hazelnuts
1 tbsp icing sugar
1 tsp lime juice

For the hazelnut praline

100g/3½oz caster sugar
100g/3½oz hazelnuts
chocolate, grated, to decorate




Method


Place the crushed biscuits and honey into a food processor and blend together. Place a chefs' ring onto a serving plate and press the biscuit mixture into the bottom of the chef's ring.


Place the mascarpone and cream into a bowl and mix together. Fold in the liqueur, vanilla seeds, hazelnuts, icing sugar and lime juice.


Place the cream mixture into the chefs' ring on top of the biscuit mixture. Level off the top with a knife. Transfer into the fridge to chill.


For the praline, melt the sugar in a clean pan over a low medium heat, until it has melted. When it caramelises or darkens in colour, add the hazelnuts.


Quickley pour the hazelnut and sugar mixture onto an oiled baking sheet and leave to set until cool. Once set, break into shards and use to decorate the top of the cheesecake


To serve, carefully remove the chefs; ring from the cheesecake and grate the chocolate over the top.
