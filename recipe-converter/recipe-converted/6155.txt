Ingredients
For the sponge pudding

55g/2oz softened butter, plus extra for greasing
55g/2oz caster sugar
1 free-range egg
55g/2oz self-raising flour
1 tbsp milk
2 tbsp orange marmalade

For the orange syrup

3 tbsp orange marmalade
squeeze fresh orange juice

For the cardamom crème anglaise

2 free-range egg yolks
2 tsp cornflour
30g/1oz caster sugar
4 cardamom pods, seeds crushed
300ml/½ pint milk




Method


For the sponge puddings, place the softened butter and sugar into a food processor and blend until smooth and light.


Add the egg, flour and milk and blend again to a smooth batter.


Grease two ramekins and add a tablespoon of marmalade into the bottom of each. Divide the sponge batter between the two ramekins making sure that the marmalade bottom is covered completely. Leave a few inches of room at the top for the sponges to rise. Cover with cling film and cook in the microwave at its highest setting for 4-5 minutes. Remove the cling film, loosen the edges of the sponge with a knife, and turn out the sponges onto two serving plates.


For the orange syrup, place the marmalade and orange juice into a small pan over a low heat and gently warm through.


For the crème anglaise, place the egg yolks, cornflour, sugar and cardamom into a small pan and stir until combined. Place over a low heat and gradually add the milk, stirring constantly, until thickened.


To serve, pour the orange syrup over each sponge and serve the cardamom crème anglaise in a jug alongside.
