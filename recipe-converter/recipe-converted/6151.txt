125g/4½oz brown sugar
½ tsp ground cinnamon
4 tbsp banana liqueur
4 bananas, peeled and quartered
4 tbsp dark rum
4 scoops ready-made vanilla ice cream, to serve




Method


Heat a frying pan over a medium heat and cook the butter, sugar and cinnamon until the sugar has melted.


Stir in the banana liqueur, then add the banana pieces and cook, stirring carefully, until softened and beginning to turn golden-brown.
