Ingredients
For the Brie en papillote

butter, for greasing
75g/2½oz Brie
1 tsp fresh thyme leaves
¼ pear, cored, sliced
dash olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the spicy pear and chilli dressing

15g/½oz butter
½ pear, cored, chopped
1 tbsp caster sugar
2 tsp white wine vinegar
pinch chilli flakes
dash olive oil
bread, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Grease a 20cm/8in x 20cm/8in square of aluminium foil or baking parchment. Place the Brie into the middle of the foil or parchment, add the thyme, pear and a little olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Seal the foil or parchment at the edges to make a bag enclosing the ingredients. Place onto a baking sheet, transfer to the oven and bake for 6-7 minutes.


For the spicy pear and chilli dressing, melt the butter in a small saucepan, add the chopped pear and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the sugar, vinegar, chilli flakes and olive oil and cook for a further 1-2 minutes.


To serve, place the Brie parcel onto a serving plate, open it and pour over the dressing. Serve with bread to dip into the hot cheese.
