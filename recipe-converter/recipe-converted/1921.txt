Ingredients

100g/3½oz cheddar cheese, grated
50ml/2fl oz double cream
2 free-range egg yolks, beaten
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 free-range egg whites




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Place the cheese and cream into a saucepan over a medium heat and stir until melted together. Remove from the heat and leave to cool for a minute, then stir in the egg yolks and season with salt and pepper.


In a bowl whisk, the egg whites until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed.


Add a spoonful of the egg white to the cheese mixture and stir.


Fold the remaining egg white through the cheese mixture, making sure to maintain volume in the whites.


Heat a small ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat and pour in the soufflée mixture. Transfer to the oven and bake for eight minutes, or until risen and cooked through.


Serve the soufflé in the frying pan.
