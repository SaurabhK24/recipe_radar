The yogurt helps to produce a light and tender scone. Use plump yellow sultanas or lexia raisins for an extra treat or substitute chopped chocolate and/or nuts for the sultanas. Or try dried cherries or chopped Medjool dates.





By Darina Allen and Rosemary Kearney






Ingredients

275g/10oz rice flour
50g/2oz tapioca flour
4 tsp gluten-free baking powder
2 tsp xanthan gum
1 tsp salt
4 tbsp caster sugar
110g/4oz butter
110g/4oz sultanas
2 eggs, preferably free-range
125ml-175ml/4-6fl oz natural yoghurt
1 egg, beaten, for egg wash




Method


Preheat the oven to 250C/475F/Gas 9.


Sift all the dry ingredients into a large bowl and mix well. Rub in the butter. Add the sultanas and gently mix together.


Lightly whisk the eggs and natural yoghurt together.


Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and add the egg and yoghurt mixture. Mix to soft dough, adding a little more natural yoghurt if necessary.


Turn onto a rice-floured board and knead lightly, just enough to shape into a round. Roll out to about 2.5cm/1in thick and cut out rounds using a 5.5cm/2¼in cutter. Place on a rice-floured baking sheet and brush with a little egg wash.


Bake for approximately 10 minutes until golden brown on top. Leave to cool on a wire rack.


Serve split in half with butter and homemade raspberry jam.
