Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
½ onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, chopped
250g/9oz basmati rice
300ml/½ pint hot vegetable stock
50g/1¾oz margarine
handful each fresh dill, parsley, chervil, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Heat the oil in a saucepan, add the onion and fry gently until softened.


Add the garlic and cook for one minute, then add the rice and stir well to coat the grains.


Add a ladleful of hot stock to the pan and stir well until almost all of the stock has been absorbed. Repeat with the rest of the stock until all the stock has been absorbed and the rice is tender.


Stir in the margarine and herbs, reserving some for the garnish, and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, transfer the risotto to a bowl and garnish with the remaining herbs.
