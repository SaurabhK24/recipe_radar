Ingredients

300ml/10fl oz vegetable oil for deep frying
1 tsp cinnamon
2 tsp caster sugar
2 ready-made flour tortillas, cut into 1cm/½in strips
1 tbsp Greek yoghurt, to serve (optional)




Method


Heat the oil in a deep heavy-bottomed saucepan, until very hot or until a breadcrumb sizzles in it (CAUTION: Hot oil is very dangerous. Do not leave unattended).


Mix the cinnamon and sugar together in a bowl.


Carefully lower the tortilla ribbons into the hot oil and deep-fry until crisp and golden. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar while still hot.


Serve piled up in a bowl with a spoon of yoghurt on top
