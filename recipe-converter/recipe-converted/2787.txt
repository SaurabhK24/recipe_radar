Ingredients
For the clear noodle broth

1 red snapper trimmings (head, tail, bones)
½ onion, peeled, sliced
500ml/18fl oz just-boiled water
100g/3½oz noodles, cooked according to packet instructions, drained

For the fish

butter, for greasing
½ red snapper fillet, skin slashed
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tsp sesame oil
pinch ground ginger
1 tbsp chopped chives
1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander leaves




Method


For the broth, simmer the fish trimmings, onion and just-boiled water in a saucepan for 10-15 minutes. Sieve the liquid into another saucepan and discard the trimmings and onion.


For the fish, place a piece of greased silicone paper in a bamboo steamer set over a pan of boiling water. Place the fish on top, skin-side down. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Scatter the remaining ingredients over the top.


Cover the pan with a lid and steam the fish for 5-7 minutes, or until it is cooked through (you will know the fish is cooked when the flesh is opaque).


To serve, heat up the broth with the cooked noodles and pour it into a bowl. Place the steamed fish into the broth.
