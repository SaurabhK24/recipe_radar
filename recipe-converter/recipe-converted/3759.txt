Ingredients

1 rhubarb stem, trimmed, peeled and finely chopped
115g/4oz caster sugar
1 vanilla pod, split in half
4 tbsp double cream
1 ready-made meringue nest, crushed
icing sugar, to dust




Method


Place the rhubarb, caster sugar and vanilla pod into a small heavy-based pan over a low heat.


Cook gently for 8-10 minutes, until the rhubarb is tender but still holding its shape.


Transfer the rhubarb mixture to a bowl and leave to cool. Discard the vanilla pod.


Meanwhile, whip the cream until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed, then carefully fold in the crushed meringue nest.


To serve, spoon the cold rhubarb into a tall serving glass and top with the cream and meringue mixture. Dust with icing sugar and serve.
