Ingredients

1 pheasant breast
1 tbsp plain flour, for dusting
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil
3 oranges, juice only
55g/2oz rocket
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp lemon juice




Method


Dredge the pheasant breast in the flour and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat the oil in a frying pan and cook the pheasant breast until golden-brown on both sides, about 4-5 minutes per side.


Add the orange juice to the pan and reduce rapidly to a sticky sauce.


To serve, dress the rocket with the olive oil and lemon juice in a bowl, then place in the centre of a serving plate. Top with the pheasant breast and pour over the orange sauce.
