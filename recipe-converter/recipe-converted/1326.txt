This beef curry is a version of a childhood memory of one of Rick Stein’s mum’s curries. The curry is finished with sultanas and desiccated coconut. Serve with chutney, salted fish and poppadoms.

Ingredients

25g/1oz butter
750g/1lb 10oz chuck steak, cut into 4cm/1½in cubes
2 medium onions, sliced
3 garlic cloves, crushed
1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
1 tsp ground turmeric
1½ tbsp garam masala
1½ tsp salt
600ml/20fl oz beef stock
50g/1¾oz desiccated coconut
100g/3½oz sultanas

To serve

choose from: Bombay duck (or any dried, salted fish such as dried anchovies, available from Asian shops), apple chutney, tamarind chutney, sliced bananas, grated coconut and/or poppadoms




Method


Melt the butter in a large, sturdy pan over a medium heat. Add the steak, in batches, and fry for a few minutes until browned and then remove to a plate. Add the onions to the same pan and fry for 10 minutes, or until softened and golden-brown.


Add the garlic and fry for one minute, then return the meat to the pan, along with any juices on the plate. Stir in the chilli powder, turmeric, one tablespoon of the garam masala, and the salt, and cook for one minute.


Add the stock, followed by the coconut and sultanas. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook over a low heat for 45 minutes to an hour or until the beef is tender. Stir in the remaining garam masala and serve.
