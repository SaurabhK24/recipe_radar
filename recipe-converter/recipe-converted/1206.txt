Ingredients
For the wild mushroom bruschetta

1 slice ciabatta bread
2 tbsp olive oil
25g/1oz butter
½ shallot, finely chopped
100g/3½oz wild mushrooms, roughly chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
75ml/2½fl oz double cream
1 tbsp chopped fresh sage
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the balsamic tomatoes

2 tbsp olive oil
150g/5½oz vine tomatoes
2 sprigs fresh thyme
2 sprigs fresh rosemary
2 tsp balsamic vinegar

To serve

2 poached free-range eggs
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the bruschetta, heat a griddle pan until hot. Drizzle the olive oil over the slice of ciabatta bread and griddle until golden-brown on both sides. Remove from the pan.


In a separate frying pan, heat the butter and gently fry the shallots, mushrooms and garlic until the mushrooms start to colour, about five minutes. Add the cream and simmer until reduced slightly, then stir in the chopped sage and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


For the tomatoes, heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan. Add the tomatoes and herbs to the pan and sear on all sides. Sprinkle over the balsamic vinegar and transfer to the oven to cook for about six minutes, or until soft.


To serve, place the griddled ciabatta onto a serving plate and top with the mushroom mixture. Place the poached eggs on top and arrange the balsamic tomatoes around the side. Garnish with parsley.
