Ingredients

900g/2lb flour
½tsp salt
125g/¼lb butter or lard
1 egg
a piece of German yeast the size of a walnut
warm milk




Method


Put the flour (which should be perfectly dry) into a basin; mix it with the salt, and rub in the butter or lard; then beat the egg well, stir in the yeast, and add these to the flour with as much warm milk as needed to make the whole mixture into a smooth paste, and knead it well.


Let it rise near the fire, and, when well risen, form it into cakes; place them on tins, let them rise again for a few minutes before putting them into the oven, and bake for ¼ to ½ hour in a moderate oven.


These are very nice with a few currants and a little sugar added to the other ingredients; they should be put in after the butter is rubbed in.


These cakes should be buttered, and eaten hot as soon as baked; but, when stale, they are very nice split and toasted; or if dipped in milk, or even water, and covered with a basin in the oven until hot, they will be almost as good as new.
