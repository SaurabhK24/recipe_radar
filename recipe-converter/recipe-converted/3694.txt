300ml/Â½ pint hot chicken stock
3 tbsp chopped fresh coriander, plus extra to serve
1 tbsp soy sauce, plus extra to serve

Method


Place the egg noodles into a bowl, pour over enough boiling water to cover them and leave for 3-4 minutes, or until softened. Drain.


Place the stock into a small saucepan, add the coriander, soy sauce and sesame oil and bring to the boil. Make a whirlpool by stirring the pan with a wooden spoon and then crack the egg into the whirlpool and whisk. Add the shredded Savoy cabbage and stir.
