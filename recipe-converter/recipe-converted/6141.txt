2 cloves garlic, crushed
6 fresh basil leaves, roughly torn

For the toasted cashew dressing

For the roasted pepper, place the pepper onto a baking tray and drizzle over one tablespoon of the oil. Place in the oven to roast for 8-10 minutes, or until tender, then remove and mix with the remaining pepper ingredients in a bowl.
