Ingredients
For the dressing

4 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp white wine vinegar
1 tsp wholegrain mustard
55g/2oz Brie, chopped
½ pear, chopped

For the salad

85g/3oz spinach
¼ red onion, sliced thinly
½ pear, cut into chunks
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 thick slice bread, crusts cut off, cut into chunks
3 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp roughly chopped fresh rosemary, to serve




Method


For the dressing, place all the ingredients in the bowl of a small food processor and process until smooth.


For the salad, place the spinach, red onion and pear into a bowl. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix gently to combine.


Drizzle the bread chunks with the olive oil and heat a frying pan until hot. Fry the bread until golden-brown on all sides.


To serve, pile the salad onto a plate and scatter the croutons on top. Drizzle over the Brie and pear dressing and garnish with chopped fresh rosemary.
