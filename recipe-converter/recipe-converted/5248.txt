Ingredients

1 tsp vegetable oil
a knob of butter
2 tbsp finely chopped onion
½ small tomato, chopped
¼ green chilli, seeded and sliced (optional), or pinch of red chilli powder
2 eggs, beaten
salt to taste
1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander




Method


Heat the oil and butter in a small non-stick frying pan. Add the onion and fry for about four minutes, until soft.
