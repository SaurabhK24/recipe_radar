These little Brazilian cheese snacks are perfect for nibbling on a hot summer day with a cold beer.





By Rogerio David






Ingredients

½kg/1lb 1½oz fresh peeled cassava, fibrous centre removed
200g/7¼oz feta cheese
4 free-range eggs
1 tbsp chopped parsley
1 tbsp chopped spring onion
salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
oil, for deep-frying




Method


Boil the cassava for at least 20 minutes, then drain and let rest for five minutes in the colander, to make sure it is thoroughly dry.


Mash the cassava with a potato masher (do not use a food processor as it will make it too gooey). Add all the other ingredients, except the oil, and mix well.


Heat the oil in a pan until very hot (CAUTION: Hot oil is very dangerous. Do not leave unattended). Using two dry spoons, shape the dough into dumplings.


Drop the dumplings into the hot oil and fry for at least five minutes. Put five or six dumplings together and then take one first to check if it is done. All the ingredients are already cooked so the centre can be a little soft.


Serve with salsa, or prepare the day before and serve in a bowl of soup.
