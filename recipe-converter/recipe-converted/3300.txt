Ingredients

2 slices ciabatta, crusts removed
25g/1oz butter, softened
2 slices prosciutto
5 fresh basil leaves
85g/3oz Dolcelatte, crumbled

For the salad

1 Little Gem lettuce, chopped
dash olive oil
dash balsamic vinegar




Method


Lay the ciabatta bread slices on a flat surface, spread one side with butter and turn over, butter-side down.


Top with prosciutto, basil and Dolcelatte, then place the other slice of bread on top, butter-side up.


Heat a non-stick frying pan, add the sandwich and pan fry for three minutes on each side. Transfer to a plate and cut into triangles.


For the salad, mix the Little Gem lettuce, olive oil and balsamic vinegar in a small bowl.


To serve, pile the Little Gem lettuce mixture onto a serving plate, top with the croque monsieur and serve immediately.
