Ingredients
For the veal1 tbsp olive oil

½ veal escalope
100g/3½oz wild mushrooms
2 tbsp brandy
25g/1oz butter
50ml/2fl oz double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp chopped chives

For the cavolo nero

25g/1oz butter
1 tbsp olive oil
150g/5½oz cavolo nero, stalks removed, finely sliced
200ml/7½fl oz vegetable stock




Method


For the veal, heat the olive oil in an ovenproof frying pan, and fry veal for 4-5 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown on all sides. Remove the veal from the pan and set aside. Keep warm.


Add the mushrooms to the same pan used to cook the veal and fry for 5-6 minutes. Return the veal to the pan.


Add the brandy, heat briefly, then set light with a match. Let the flames flare up, then die down. Cook for 3-4 mins longer until most of the liquid has evaporated. (CAUTION: Keep the flames away from the eyes and face. Do not leave unattended.)


Add the butter and cream, bring to the boil and heat for one minute. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then stir in the chopped chives.


For the cavolo nero, melt the butter and olive oil in a frying pan and add the cavolo nero. Fry for one minute, then pour in the stock, bring the mixture to the boil and boil for 4-5 minutes, or until tender.


To serve, spoon the veal and wild mushrooms onto a serving plate and serve the cavolo nero alongside.
