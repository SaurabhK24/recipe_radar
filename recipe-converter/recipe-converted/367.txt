The basic rule is one part rice to one and a half parts water, but the longer you soak it the less time it needs.

Ingredients

200g/7oz basmati rice, cleaned and soaked in cold water for 30 minutes
365ml/13fl oz water
½ tsp lemon juice (optional)




Method


Drain the rice and place it into a pot with the fresh water. Bring to the boil.


Add the lemon juice to the water and stir thoroughly. Cover the pan with a lid before reducing the heat. Simmer gently for 7-8 minutes


When the rice is cooked remove the lid and take the pan off the heat. Leave the rice to stand for five minutes to allow excess moisture to leave the pan.


To serve, fluff the rice using a fork before placing a spoonful on each of four serving plates.
