Ingredients
For the aerated chocolate

500g/1lb 2oz good quality milk chocolate (minimum 40% cocoa solids)
2 tbsp sunflower oil

For the yuzu purée

125ml/4fl oz yuzu juice
150ml/5fl oz sugar syrup
5½g agar-agar
salt, for seasoning
citric acid, for seasoning

For the miso salt

10g/¼oz dried miso powder
20g/¾oz sea salt flakes




Method


For the aerated chocolate, melt the chocolate with the sunflower oil and leave to infuse for 1 hour.


Strain into an espuma gun and charge with 2 bulbs.


Spray 100g/3½oz into a plastic container and place into a vacuum pack machine. Then place in a sous-vide machine and turn off when the chocolate reaches the top of the container.


Leave in the fridge for at least 2 hours. Remove from container and cut into 4 portions.


For the yuzu purée, mix the yuzu juice, sugar syrup and agar-agar together. Place in a pan and bring up to the boil. Pour into a container and leave to set.


Once set, transfer to a blender and blend until smooth. Strain and if needed, season with a little salt and citric acid.


For the miso salt, gently coat the salt in the miso powder and store in an airtight container until needed.


To serve, pipe 5 dots of the yuzu purée across each portion of the aerated chocolate and dust with 4 to 5 grains of the miso salt.
