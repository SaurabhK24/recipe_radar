Ingredients
For the tomatoes

1 tbsp olive oil
handful vine cherry tomatoes
2 tbsp sugar

For the fish

170g/6oz sea bass fillet
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp butter
25g/1oz rocket
3 tbsp balsamic vinegar

For the salad

25g/1oz rocket
olive oil
small bunch of fresh chives, finely chopped, to garnish




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the tomatoes, heat the oil over a low heat in an ovenproof frying pan. Add the tomatoes and the sugar and place into the oven for 10-12 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside.


Meanwhile, for the sea bass, season the fillet with salt and freshly ground black pepper, and score the skin-side with a knife.


Heat the oil and the butter in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the sea bass fillet, skin-side down and cook for two minutes.


Turn the fillet over and cook for a further 30 seconds, or until cooked through, then remove from the pan and set aside in a warm place.


Tear the rocket leaves and add to the same pan with the balsamic vinegar. Cook for five minutes to reduce the balsamic vinegar to a thick sauce.


For the salad, place the rocket in a bowl and drizzle with olive oil.


To serve, place the rocket salad onto a large plate and top with the sea bass. Drizzle the sea bass with the balsamic and rocket pan juices and sprinkle with chives. Place the roasted tomatoes around the plate.
