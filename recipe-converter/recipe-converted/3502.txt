Ingredients

vegetable oil, for deep frying
1 small squid, cleaned, skin removed, body cut into rings
2 tbsp self-raising flour
1 tsp cornflour
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 wedge lime




Method


Two thirds fill a heavy-based pan with the vegetable oil. Mix the flours in a bowl and season with salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste.


Dredge the squid with the flour so it is evenly coated.


Heat the vetetable oil. Test to see if the oil is hot enough to fry the squid by dropping in a pinch of flour. It should sizzle straight away. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) In small batches, carefully drop the squid in the hot oil and fry for 2-4 minutes or until golden-brown. Lift out with a slotted spoon, drain on kitchen towel and keep warm. Repeat until all the squid is cooked.


Serve the squid with a wedge of lime.
