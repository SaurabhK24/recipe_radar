Ingredients

1 onion, peeled and finely chopped
1 tbsp vegetable oil
2 tsp chopped fresh parsley
2 tsp chopped fresh thyme leaves
85g/3oz fresh white breadcrumbs
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 egg, beaten




Method


Sweat the onion in the oil until soft but not coloured.


Mix the onion with the breadcrumbs and herbs and season well. Stir in enough egg to bind.


Use to stuff meat or poultry, or roll into individual stuffing balls - cook these in the roasting tin with the meat for 30 minutes at the end of the cooking time.




Recipe Tips
If you are making this as a dairy-free recipe, take care to ensure the breadcrumbs are dairy free. Although many breads contain dairy, free-from options are widely available - just check the label.
