Ingredients

2 tbsp olive oil
½ banana shallot, peeled and sliced
1 garlic clove, peeled and chopped
4 pheasant thighs
100ml/3½fl oz red wine
100ml/3½fl oz beef stock

To serve

knob of butter
1 tbsp olive oil
handful chopped cavalo nero (black-leaf kale)




Method


Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the shallot and garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes, to soften.


Add the pheasant thighs to the pan and continue to sauté for 8-10 minutes, until the pheasant is crispy, golden and thoroughly cooked.


Add the wine and stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for a further 8-10 minutes, until the sauce has reduced.


Meanwhile, heat the oil and butter in a separate pan. Add the cavalo nero and sauté for a few minutes.


To serve, transfer the pheasant and sauce to a warm dish and spoon the cavalo nero alongside.
