Ingredients
For the red pepper and sweet chilli sauce

Â½ red pepper, seeds removed, flesh sliced into strips
olive oil, for drizzling
salt and freshly ground black pepper
5 tbsp sweet chilli sauce
1 tsp lime juice

For the egg fu yung

3 tbsp groundnut oil
1 small handful shiitake mushrooms or chestnut mushrooms, sliced
1 red pepper, de-seeded and diced
75g/3oz smoked bacon, diced
5 free-range eggs, lightly beaten
dash light soy sauce
pinch freshly ground white pepper
mixed salad leaves, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/390F/Gas 6.


For the red pepper and sweet chilli sauce, place the sliced pepper onto a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Roast in the oven for ten minutes, or until softened, then transfer to a food processor. Add the sweet chilli sauce and lime juice and blend to a smooth paste.


For the egg fu yung, heat a wok until smoking and add the groundnut oil. Add the mushrooms, red pepper and bacon and stir-fry for one minute, or until crisp and golden-brown.


Add the stir-fry mixture to the beaten eggs and stir to combine.


Carefully wipe out any excess oil from the wok with kitchen paper. Place the wok over a high heat and add the remaining oil, swirling to coat the wok. Add half the beaten egg mixture and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until golden-brown on the underside. Flip the omelette over and cook for another minute on the other side, or until golden-brown and cooked through. Season with soy sauce and freshly ground white pepper. Slide onto on a warmed plate and cover with foil. Repeat with the remaining egg mixture.


To serve, arrange the mixed salad leaves on a plate and place the omelette to the side. Spoon over the red pepper and sweet chilli sauce and serve immediately.
