Ingredients
For the trout

40g/1½oz butter
2 trout, filleted and skinned
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 stems rhubarb, sliced very thinly
2 tsp caster sugar
½ tsp ground ginger

For the croûtons

½ crusty white loaf
2 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the salad

½ lemon, juice and zest
1 tsp Dijon mustard
salt and freshly ground black pepper
3-4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
50g/2oz mizuna leaves
50g/2oz baby spinach leaves
25g/1oz flatleaf parsley leaves




Method


For the trout, heat a frying pan until hot and add half of the butter.


Season the trout with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste, and place in the pan.


Cook for two minutes, before carefully turning over with a fish slice and frying for a minute more. Remove the fish from the pan and set aside in a warm place.


Heat a separate frying pan and add the remaining butter. Add the rhubarb, sugar and ground ginger and stir fry briefly until the rhubarb has just softened and the sugar has dissolved. Set aside in a warm place.


For the croûtons, slice the crusts from the bread and cut into 1cm/½in cubes.


Heat a frying pan until hot and add the olive oil. Add the cubed bread and salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste. Fry for 2-3 minutes until golden-brown and crunchy.


Transfer the fried bread to a plate lined with kitchen paper.


For the salad, place the lemon juice and zest into a small bowl and add the mustard. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and whisk in the olive oil.


Place the mizuna, baby spinach and flatleaf parsley leaves into a bowl, along with the croutons and the dressing and mix to combine.


Divide the trout equally among four plates and top with some of the rhubarb. Place a pile of salad alongside and serve.
