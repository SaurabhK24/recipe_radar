Cook these veggie kebabs on the barbecue or under the grill. If you're short on time use teriyaki sauce instead of the marinade and ready-made satay sauce in place of the dressing.

Ingredients

1 red pepper, de-seeded and cubed
1 yellow pepper, de-seeded and cubed
12 cherry tomatoes
4 salad onions topped, tailed and cut into 5cm/2in lengths
2 baby courgettes, cut into chunks
groundnut oil or sunflower oil, for grilling
4 kebab skewers
basmati rice, to serve

For the marinade

2-3 tbsp soy sauce
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 tsp sugar
pinch of ground ginger
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

For the dressing

1 tbsp groundnut or sunflower oil
1 shallot, finely chopped
½ tsp hot chilli powder
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 tbsp dark brown sugar
110g/4oz unsalted roasted peanuts, ground
150ml/5fl oz coconut milk
½ lemon, juice only




Method


Mix all the vegetables together in a bowl. Combine the marinade ingredients in a separate bowl and pour over the vegetables, making sure the vegetables are evenly coated.


Cover and leave for two hours, stirring occasionally.


For the dressing, heat the oil in a small pan and fry the shallot until starting to brown. Add the chilli powder and cook for one minute.


Stir in two tablespoons of the marinade from the vegetables, the garlic, sugar and ground peanuts. Stir well.


Add the coconut milk a little at a time. Bring to the boil and simmer gently for two minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and season to taste.


Thread the marinated vegetables on to skewers. Brush with a little oil and grill over the coals for about 15 minutes, turning occasionally.


Gently re-heat the peanut dressing.


Serve the kebabs on a bed of rice, drizzled with peanut dressing.
