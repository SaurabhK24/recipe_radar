Turn leftover Christmas pudding into a whole new fun dessert with just a few simple ingredients!



Ingredients

400g/14oz leftover Christmas pudding (about half a large pudding)
2 tbsp dry sherry
400g tin pear halves in juice
500g/1lb 2oz ready-made custard
150g/5½oz mascarpone
300ml/10fl oz whipping or double cream
1 square of dark chocolate
handful of flaked almonds (optional)




Method


Break the Christmas pudding into chunks and place it in the bottom of a trifle bowl in an even layer. Sprinkle over the sherry and 1 tablespoon of the pear juice.


Drain the pears and cut each one in half, then layer them on top of the cake.


Beat together the custard and mascarpone and spoon on top of the pears.


Whisk the cream until soft peaks form, then spoon it onto the custard. Finely grate over the chocolate and sprinkle over the flaked almonds, if using.
