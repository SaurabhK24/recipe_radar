Ingredients

55g/2oz parmesan cheese, grated
1 tomato, chopped
1 tbsp ready-made tapenade
handful fresh basil leaves, chopped




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Place four chefs' rings on a baking sheet and fill with a handful of parmesan.


Bake in the oven for five minutes or until golden. Remove from the oven and while warm and pliable, shape around the top of a rolling pin to form a cup.


Mix the tomato, tapenade and basil together and spoon the mixture into each parmesan crisp cup.
