Ingredients

vegetable oil, for deep frying
150g/5oz cornmeal or polenta
125g/4oz plain flour
50g/2oz sugar
3 tsp baking powder
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 free-range egg
225ml/8fl oz full-fat milk
12-15 frankfurter sausages
12-15 wooden skewers, soaked

To serve

6 tbsp mayonnaise
2 tbsp Dijon mustard




Method


Heat the vegetable oil in a deep-fat fryer to 160C/320F. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Mix together all of the dry ingredients in a bowl. In a separate bowl, beat the egg and milk together and gradually stir the mixture into to the dry ingredients. Whisk together to make a heavy batter.


Put a skewer through each frankfurter sausage and dip it into the batter until well coated.


Place the frankfurters into the deep-fat fryer, a few at a time, and cook for three minutes, or until golden-brown. Drain on a plate lined with kitchen paper.


To serve, mix the mustard and mayonnaise together in a bowl and serve with the frankfurters.
