Ingredients

1 tsp olive oil or butter
12 slices good quality ham
12 large eggs
2 tbsp cream
sea salt
freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp roughly chopped parsley
4 tbsp grated parmesan




Method


Heat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Lightly oil or butter a 12 hole muffin tray. Line the base and most of the sides of each mould with a slice of ham, then break an egg into the hollow.


Drizzle with the cream, and scatter with sea salt, pepper, parsley and parmesan.


Bake for 15-20 minutes until the egg is just set and starting to shrink away from the sides of the tin.


Leave to cool for five minutes, then run a knife around each mould to loosen the ham and egg, and remove to a wire tray. Eat warm, or at room temperature.


Serve with a handful of herb and baby leaf salad.
