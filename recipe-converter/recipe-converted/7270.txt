Ingredients

½ parsnip, peeled, cored and grated
½ small potato, peeled and grated
50g/2oz unsalted butter
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tsp chopped fresh parsley, to garnish




Method


Place the grated potato and parsnip onto a clean tea towel and squeeze over a bowl to remove the excess liquid.


Melt the butter with the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, add the grated potato and parsnip, press down and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Fry the rösti for 2-3 minutes on each side, using a fish slice to carefully turn it over, until crisp and golden-brown.


To serve, place the rösti onto a plate and sprinkle over the parsley.
