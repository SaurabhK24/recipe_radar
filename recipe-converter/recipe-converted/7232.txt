Ingredients
For the salad

2 tbsp olive oil
3 slices parma ham
4 thin slices ciabatta
200g/7oz baby spinach, washed
½ beef tomato, seeds removed, chopped

For the dressing

1 tbsp chopped fresh chives
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the salad, heat one tablespoon of the oil in a large non-stick frying pan and fry the parma ham for one minute on each side, or until golden-brown. Remove from the pan and drain on kitchen paper.


In the same pan, heat the remaining oil, place the ciabatta slices into the pan and cook until golden-brown.


Place the spinach and tomato into a large bowl. Place the dressing ingredients into a small bowl, mix together well and pour over the salad. Mix well to combine.


Transfer the salad to a large plate and top with the croutons and parma ham.
