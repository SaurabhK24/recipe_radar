Ingredients
For the gnocchi

100g/3½oz walnuts
200g/7oz plain flour, plus extra for coating
300g/10½oz butternut squash, peeled, deseeded, chopped, cooked and drained

For the sage butter

100g/3½oz unsalted butter
1 tbsp sage leaves, plus extra to garnish
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


To make the gnocchi, place the walnuts in a food processor and blend. Add the flour and cooked butternut squash and blend together.


Divide the mixture into 4 and toss in plain flour. Roll each into a long, thin sausage, then chop into 2.5cm/1in pieces. Toss again in flour to coat, then drop into a pan of boiling water.


After a minute the gnocchi should float to the surface. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.


To make the sage butter, melt the butter in a frying pan, then add the sage leaves. Fry for a minute to infuse, then add the gnocchi and toss together.


Serve the gnocchi in a warm bowl and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
