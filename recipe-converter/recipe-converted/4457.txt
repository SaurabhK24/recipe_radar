Ingredients

gooseberries
3 eggs
40g/1½oz butter
300ml/½ pint breadcrumbs
sugar to taste
a little puff-pastry




Method


Top and tail the gooseberries, and put them into a jar. Place this jar in boiling water, and let it boil until the gooseberries are soft enough to pulp.


Then beat them through a coarse sieve, and to every pint of pulp add 3 well-whisked eggs, 40g/1½oz butter, 300ml/½ pint breadcrumbs, and sugar to taste.


Beat the mixture well, put a border of puff-pastry round the edge of a pie-dish, put in the pudding, bake for about 40 minutes, sprinkle with sifted sugar and serve.
