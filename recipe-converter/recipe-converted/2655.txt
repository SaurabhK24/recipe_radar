These Christmas biscuits make perfect presents and they can also be made into Christmas tree decorations.



Ingredients

100g/3½oz unsalted butter, softened at room temperature
100g/3½oz caster sugar
1 free-range egg, lightly beaten
1 tsp vanilla extract
275g/10oz plain flour
To decorate
400g/14oz icing sugar
3-4 tbsp water
2-3 drops food colourings
Edible glitter




Method


Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5. Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper.


Cream the butter and sugar together in a bowl until pale, light and fluffy.


Beat in the egg and vanilla extract, a little at a time, until well combined.


Stir in the flour until the mixture comes together as a dough.


Roll the dough out on a lightly floured work surface to a thickness of 1cm/½in.


Using biscuit cutters or a glass, cut biscuits out of the dough and carefully place onto the baking tray. To make into Christmas tree decorations, carefully make a hole in the top of the biscuit using a straw.


Bake the biscuits for 8-10 minutes, or until pale golden-brown. Set aside to harden for 5 minutes, then cool on a wire rack.


For the icing, sift the icing sugar into a large mixing bowl and stir in enough water to create a smooth mixture. Stir in the food colouring.


Carefully spread the icing onto the biscuits using a knife and sprinkle over the glitter. Set aside until the icing hardens.




Recipe Tips
To make honey biscuits, swap the caster sugar for 70g/2½oz honey and 30g/1oz caster sugar. Increase the vanilla extract to 2 teaspoons. Cook at 180C/Fan 160/Gas 4. Pipe on Christmas shapes with 40g/1½oz melted white chocolate instead of using icing.
  For reduced sugar biscuits, use 60g/2½oz soft brown muscovado sugar instead of 100g/3½oz caster sugar. Increase the vanilla extract to 2 teaspoons. Add 1 teaspoons ground cinnamon and 1 tbsp finely chopped candied peel with the flour. Decorate with halved blanched almonds instead of icing.
