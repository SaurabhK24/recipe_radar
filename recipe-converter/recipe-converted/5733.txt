Ingredients

1.375kg/3lb 1oz self-raising flour
200g/7oz caster sugar
550g/1lb 4oz shredded suet
5 lemons, zest only
about 700ml/1¼ pint water
375g/13oz lemon curd
50ml/2fl oz whole milk




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas mark 6.


Place the flour, sugar, suet and lemon zest into a large bowl and mix thoroughly.


Make a well in the centre of the mixture then gradually add enough water to make a soft dough. Knead lightly until smooth and divide into five portions.


Roll each portion of dough out on a floured surface into a rectangle about 1cm/½in thick. Spread the lemon curd out on the dough leaving a 1cm/½in border.


Roll up from the short side into a pinwheel, seal the ends well with a little water and place onto greased baking trays. Brush with the milk.


Place in the oven for 35-40 minutes, or until golden brown.
