Make this recipe your first stop for a nourishing morning muffin. If you prepare the dry ingredients the night before, you can easily whip up a fresh batch first thing in the morning.






By Tim Maddams






Ingredients

300g/10½oz self-raising flour, sifted
1 tsp baking powder
pinch salt
1 tsp ground cinnamon
150g/5½oz light brown sugar
250ml/9fl oz full-fat milk
2 free-range eggs, beaten
100g/3½oz butter, melted
100g/3½oz toasted, skinned hazelnuts, chopped
25g/1oz dried cherries
25g/1oz dried cranberries
75g/2½oz crunchy granola




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and line a muffin tray with paper muffin cases.


In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon and then stir in the sugar. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs and melted butter, then pour into the dry ingredients and quickly mix together. Stir in the hazelnuts, dried cherries and dried cranberries.


Divide the batter between the 12 muffin cases and sprinkle the top of each with the granola.


Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle of the muffins comes out clean. Leave to cool for five minutes in the tin before serving warm or at room temperature.
