Ingredients
For the poached chicken

1 free-range egg white
2 tbsp cornflour
1 tbsp vegetable oil
5 chicken mini-fillets

For the herb paste

handful fresh parsley
large handful fresh basil
1 garlic clove, crushed
4 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

To serve

4 red and yellow cherry tomatoes
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
1 tsp almond butter, from a jar




Method


For the poached chicken, place the egg white, cornflour and vegetable oil into a bowl and mix well. Bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil. Dip the chicken mini-fillets into the egg white mixture and poach in the boiling water for 3-4 minutes, or until completely cooked through. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


For the herb paste, place all of the herb paste ingredients into a small food processor and process until smooth.


In a large bowl, combine the poached chicken fillets, the pesto and the halved cherry tomatoes. Serve on a plate and garnish with chopped fresh parsley and almond butter.
