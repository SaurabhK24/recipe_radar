Ingredients

700g/1½lb '00' flour, plus extra for dusting
10 medium free-range eggs
semolina, for dusting (optional)




Method


Pour the flour into a mound onto a flat surface and make a well in the centre. Crack the eggs into the well and gradually mix with either a blunt knife or your hands. When the dough has become a thick paste use your hands to incorporate more of the flour.


You can sieve any remaining flour and use the sifted flour while you knead the dough to stop it from sticking to the surface and to your hands, but be careful not to make the dough too dry. Knead until well blended and the dough is soft and flexible. Don't worry if you haven't used up all the flour.


Leave the pasta to rest for about 20 minutes with a bowl inverted over it or leave it covered in cling film. You can sieve any leftover flour again and save this flour for rolling out the pasta.


Divide the pasta in half before rolling it out to prevent it drying out. Wrap the half you are not using in cling film.


Begin by flattening the dough with the palm of your hand, then roll the pasta out using a heavy wooden rolling pin (a pasta machine could also be used).


Dust the surface, the pasta and the rolling pin with flour to prevent it sticking. When the dough is thin enough to see your fingers through it, it is ready to be cut into whichever pasta shape you choose.


When cut, separate into individual pieces and toss with dried semolina or a little more flour to prevent the pasta sticking to itself. Leave it on a floured tray and cook within the hour. Repeat to use up the remaining dough.


Cook in boiling salted water for 3-5 minutes, depending on the thickness of the strands or shapes.
