Ingredients
For the caramel shards

100g/3½oz caster sugar

For the toasted almonds

55g/2oz almonds

For the coulis

150g/5½oz fresh raspberries
2 tsp icing sugar
squeeze of lemon juice

For the floating islands

2 free-range egg whites
110g/4oz caster sugar




Method


Heat the sugar in a heavy-bottomed saucepan until it dissolves, without stirring. When it darkens to a deep caramel colour, using an oiled spoon, drizzle the caramel onto a piece of non-stick baking paper and leave to cool.


Heat the almonds in a dry pan over medium heat, and fry until toasted and golden all over. Allow to cool.


Place the raspberries, sugar and lemon juice into a food processor and blend until smooth. Transfer into a sieve and push through with a spoon to remove the seeds.


Place the egg whites into a clean bowl and whisk until the mixture forms stiff peaks when the whisk is removed.


Gradually add the caster sugar until it is all incorporated, whisking continuously. The mixture will become very thick and glossy.


Boil a saucepan of water and drop teaspoonfuls of meringue into the water to poach for 3-4 minutes.


Pour the raspberry coulis onto a serving plate, and carefully tip it around so it covers the base. Arrange the poached meringues into the centre and sprinkle over the toasted almonds and shards of caramel.
