Garlicky roasted aubergine makes a wonderful smoky addition to hummus dip.






By Nigel Slater


From Nigel and Adam's Farm Kitchen






Ingredients

1 medium aubergine, cut into 1cm/½in discs
3 garlic cloves, chopped
6 tbsp olive oil
400g/14oz can chickpeas, drained
3 sprigs rosemary




Method


Set the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Lay the aubergine on a baking tray, scatter over the chopped garlic and half of the olive oil.


Bake in the oven for 15 minutes.


Drain the chickpeas and warm through in a pan with the remaining olive oil and the rosemary.


When the aubergine is softened and lightly toasted (after about 15 minutes), remove from the oven.


Place half of the chickpeas and half of the aubergines in a food processor and blend until smooth.


Return the blended mix back to the pan and add the rest of the aubergines and warm through for a minute.


Serve hot.
