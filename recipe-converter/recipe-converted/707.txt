1 small red and 1 small green pepper de-seeded and cut into strips

1 small onion chopped
400g/14oz can chopped tomatoes
10 black olives (with stones)
handful fresh basil
knob of butter
olive oil
Salt and pepper

Method


Sauté the turkey in butter and oil until it is brown and cooked through.


In another pan, heat some olive oil and sauté the onion and garlic, add the sliced peppers and cook for a few minutes.


Stir in the tomatoes and olives and simmer gently until the sauce has reduced and thickened slightly.


Add torn basil at the end of cooking.




Recipe Tips
If using turkey strips, add these to the sauce, and serve over the pasta with grated parmesan. If using turkey escalopes, serve with the sauce poured over, accompanied by the pasta and grated parmesan.
