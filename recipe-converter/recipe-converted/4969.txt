Ingredients
For the apple pie

350g/12oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting
200g/7oz cold butter, cubed
1 free-range egg yolk
2-3 tbsp water, to bind
2 apples, peeled, cored and sliced
2 tbsp caster sugar
½ tsp ground cinnamon

For the cinnamon cream

200ml/7fl oz double cream
½ tsp ground cinnamon
1 tbsp icing sugar, plus extra for sprinkling




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the pie, place the flour and 175g/6oz of the butter into a food processor and pulse until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the egg, then add just enough water, one tablespoon at a time, to bind the mixture. Blend briefly to bring the mixture together as a dough.


Tip the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead gently. Shape into a ball and roll out into a flat circle with the thickness of a pound coin. Place onto a baking sheet lined with greaseproof parchment.


Arrange the sliced apple on the pastry, leaving a 2.5cm/1in gap around the edges, then sprinkle over the caster sugar and cinnamon and dot with the remaining butter. Draw the edges of the pastry up to form a crust and pinch to hold in place. Bake for 8-10 minutes in the oven, or until the pastry is golden-brown and crisp.


For the cinnamon cream, whisk the cream together in a bowl with the cinnamon and icing sugar until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed.


Serve the apple pie with spoonfuls of the cinnamon cream and a sprinkle of icing sugar.
