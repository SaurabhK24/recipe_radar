Ingredients

1 tbsp corn oil
350g/12¼oz smoked streaky bacon, diced
2 spring onions, finely chopped
115g/4¼oz corn kernels
½ tsp dried chilli flakes
300g/10½oz polenta
350g/12¼oz plain flour
1 tbsp caster sugar
1 tsp baking powder
½ tsp baking soda
½ tsp salt
375ml/13½fl oz buttermilk
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 tbsp maple syrup
½ tsp ground black pepper
2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/390F/Gas 6. Lightly butter a cake tin.


Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the bacon until it is crisp and releases its fat. Add the spring onions and cook for five minutes, then add the corn kernels and chilli flakes and stir to combine. Allow to cool slightly.


Combine the polenta, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the bacon mixture, the buttermilk, eggs, maple syrup, black pepper and half the melted butter. Mix well.


Pour the batter into the prepared cake tin and brush the top with the remaining melted butter. Bake until golden (about 20-25 minutes). Serve warm.
