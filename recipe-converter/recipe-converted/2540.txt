Feast on this gloriously simple chocolate fondue.






By James Martin


From Housecall






Ingredients

110g/4oz sugar
110ml4fl oz water
400g/14oz plain chocolate, broken in pieces
2 tbsp golden syrup
selection of fruits cut in bite-sized pieces such as orange, banana, grapes, dates or pineapple.




Method


Heat the sugar and water in a saucepan until the sugar melts and the mixture resembles a syrup.


Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. (Do not lot the base of the bowl touch the water.)


Stir in the golden syrup and enough sugar syrup to form a smooth sauce. (Caution: the chocolate mixture will be very hot, allow to cool a little before serving.)


Serve with the platter of fruit.
