Home made custard is always a winner for pouring over traditional puds. Use a little more cornflour if you like your custard thick.

Ingredients

2 large free-range egg yolks
2 tsp cornflour
25g/1oz caster sugar
1 vanilla pod, split lengthways, or ½ tsp good-quality vanilla extract
250ml/9fl oz whole milk
250ml/9fl oz double cream




Method


Put the egg yolks in a medium saucepan with the cornflour and sugar. Scrape the vanilla seeds into the pan, or add the vanilla extract, and use a metal whisk to combine all the ingredients.


Gradually whisk in the milk and cream then place the pan over a low heat and cook gently for 6-8 minutes, whisking constantly, until smooth and thick. (Do not allow the custard to boil.)
