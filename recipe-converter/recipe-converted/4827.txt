An indulgent meal for one: fresh Dover sole reaches new heights with luscious butter sauce and tiny brown shrimps.






By James Martin


From James Martin's Food Map of Britain






Ingredients

1 whole Dover sole, skinned and trimmed
25g/1oz plain flour, seasoned with salt and pepper
25ml/1fl oz olive oil
50g/1¾oz butter
1 shallot, finely chopped
½ lemon, juice only
10g/1/3oz capers
10g/1/3oz fresh parsley, chopped
50g/1¾oz brown shrimp
salt and black pepper
1 lemon, for garnish




Method


Dust the sole in the seasoned flour. Heat a large frying pan until hot, drizzle over the oil and fry the sole on both sides for 2-3 minutes.


In another pan, melt the butter. Add the shallots and cook until they are soft and translucent and the butter is a nut-brown colour. Add the lemon juice (take care as the fat will spit).


Drain the shallots in a fine sieve set over a bowl and use the back of a spoon to squeeze any butter from the shallots. Reserve the buttery juices and discard the shallots. Stir the capers, parsley and shrimps through the flavoured butter and season with salt and pepper to taste.


To make the garnish, carefully peel the lemon and then use a spoon to remove any pith. Finely slice the lemon into rounds (so they resemble flowers).


To serve, spoon the sauce over the sole and top with lemon slices.
