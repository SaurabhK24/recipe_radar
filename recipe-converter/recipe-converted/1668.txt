Ingredients

675g/1lb 8oz carrots, peeled and chopped
100g/4oz apricots, cut into quarters using scissors
2 tbsp thick cream, optional
salt and black pepper to taste




Method


Steam the carrots and apricots together for 20 minutes, until the carrots are very soft.


Process to a fine puree in food processor. Add cream and season to taste.


The puree may be piped into rosette shapes and garnished with steamed carrot flowers.


To make carrot flowers, use a channelling knife (also known as a canelle knife, available from cookware shops) to cut 5 equally spaced grooves down from top to bottom of a peeled carrot.


Slice the carrot crossways into rounds to achieve a flower shape.
