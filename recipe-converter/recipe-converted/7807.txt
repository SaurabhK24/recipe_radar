Ingredients

2 lemons, juice only
12 white peppercorns
200ml/7fl oz white wine
150ml/5fl oz water
1 tsp sea salt
6 x 125g/4oz salmon tail fillets
150g/5oz cooking chorizo, cut into chunks
100ml/3Â½fl oz dry sherry
250g/9oz frozen peas
1 tbsp chopped fresh dill
125ml/4fl oz extra virgin olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
handful mixed salad leaves, to serve




Method


Place half of the lemon juice, the peppercorns, white wine, water and sea salt into a deep frying pan over a medium heat and bring to a gentle simmer.


Add the salmon fillets, topping up the poaching liquid with more water if necessary to coner the fillets. Bring the poaching liquid back up to a simmer, then remove the pan from the heat and leave for 20-25 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through.


Remove the salmon from the poaching liquid and set aside to cool.


Heat a clean frying pan until very hot, then add the chorizo. Fry until just beginning to crisp, then add the sherry, Boil and reduce the liquid by two thirds.


Take off the heat and add the remaining lemon juice.


Add the peas, dill and olive oil. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir well to combine.


To serve, place a handful of mixed salad leaves onto each plate. Place the fillet on top and drizzle generously with the peas and chorizo dressing.
