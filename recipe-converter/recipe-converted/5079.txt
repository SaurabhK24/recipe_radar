Ingredients

2 fresh figs
2 tbsp clear honey
30g/1oz butter, cubed
2 sprigs fresh thyme
2 slices brioche, griddled
ready-made vanilla custard, warmed, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Cut a cross into the top of each fig and squeeze the bottom slightly to open it out. Place in a gratin dish, drizzle over the honey, butter and thyme and bake for 6-7 minutes.


Remove from the oven and place on top of the griddled brioche on a serving plate. Pour over the warm vanilla custard and serve immediately.
