Ingredients

200g/7oz butter
300g/10½oz quality white chocolate, chopped
3 medium eggs
150g/5oz caster sugar
½ tsp pure vanilla extract
200g/7oz plain flour, sifted
pinch of salt
icing sugar for serving

For the chillies

1 large fresh red chilli, de-seeded
1 large fresh green chilli, de-seeded
100g/3½oz caster sugar
150ml/5fl oz water




Method


Heat the oven to 180C/355F/Gas 4.


Lightly butter a 20cm x 30cm/8in x 12in straight-sided baking tin and line the base with greaseproof paper.


Finely slice the chillies on the diagonal.


Combine the sugar, water and chillies and bring to the boil, stirring. Simmer for five minutes.


In a heatproof bowl set over a pot of barely simmering water, melt the butter with 150g/5oz of the white chocolate, whisking well until smooth. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.


In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, sugar and vanilla together until pale. Beat in the melted white chocolate mixture.


Fold in the sifted flour and salt, then the remaining chopped white chocolate. Drain the chillies and add most of them to the batter.


Pour into the baking pan, strew the remaining chillies on top, and bake for 25 minutes or until the top is firm and lightly golden. Remove and cool in the pan.


Cut into small or large squares, dust with icing sugar and serve.
