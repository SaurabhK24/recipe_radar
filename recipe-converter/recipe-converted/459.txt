This simple spiced savoury jam tastes great with cheeses, cold meats and antipasti, or as a dipping sauce.

Ingredients

650g/1lb 7oz ripe tomatoes, skinned, chopped
2 shallots, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, crushed
½ red chilli, deseeded, finely chopped
½ lemon, zest and juice
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
½ tsp pectin
225g/8oz caster sugar
1 tbsp finely chopped fresh basil leaves




Method


Put the tomatoes, shallots, garlic, chilli, lemon zest and juice, vinegar and pectin in a saucepan and bring to the boil.


Stir in the sugar, then continue to boil until the mixture reaches 103C (use a sugar thermometer for this; it should take about 20 minutes). (CAUTION: hot sugar can be dangerous. Keep your eye on the pot at all times.)


Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the basil. Set aside to cool for 20 minutes.


Pour the jam into sterilised jars, seal and set aside until completely cooled.


This jam will keep for up to 6 months.
