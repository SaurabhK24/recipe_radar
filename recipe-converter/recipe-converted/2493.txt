Ingredients
For the chocolate and raspberry cheesecake

butter, for greasing
2 tbsp porridge oats
50g/1¾oz fresh raspberries
75g/2½oz cream cheese
75ml/2½fl oz double cream
1 tbsp caster sugar
1 tbsp dark chocolate, grated
fresh mint sprig, to garnish
icing sugar, to dust

For the chocolate sauce

75ml/2½fl oz boiling water
100g/3½oz caster sugar
50g/1¾oz cocoa powder
75g/2½oz dark chocolate, chopped
2 tbsp vegetable oil




Method


For the chocolate and raspberry cheesecake, lightly grease a 5cm/2in chefs' ring and place it onto a serving plate. Place half of the oats into the ring, then top with half the raspberries.


Place the cream cheese, cream and sugar into a bowl and mix well. Spoon this mixture on top of the raspberries, then top with the remaining oats and the grated chocolate.


Heat the outside of the chefs' ring with a mini-blowtorch to loosen it, then carefully slide it off. Place the remaining raspberries on top of the cheesecake and garnish with a sprig of mint.


For the chocolate sauce, place all the chocolate sauce ingredients into a small saucepan and heat gently, stirring until the chocolate has melted and the sauce has thickened.


To serve, drizzle the chocolate sauce over the cheesecake.
