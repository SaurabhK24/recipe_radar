Method


For the fricassée, heat the olive oil in a pan and fry the onion and garlic for 3-4 minutes, or until softened. Add the poussin pieces and fry for 2-3 minutes on both sides, or until starting to colour.


Pour in the wine and stock, bring to the boil and cook for 6-8 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half. Stir in the cream, add the peas and cook for a further 3-4 minutes, or until the peas are tender. Stir in the tarragon and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


For the rice, cook the rice according to packet instructions, adding the turmeric to the cooking water.
