Ingredients

¼ orange pepper, seeds removed
1 cooked chicken breast, skin removed, sliced
4 new potatoes
2 heaped tbsp canned red kidney beans, rinsed and drained
3 whole garlic cloves, skins left on
1 tsp plain flour
pinch paprika
pinch vegetable bouillon powder
125ml/4½fl oz boiling water
½ tsp yeast extract, such as Marmite or Bovril
steamed green beans, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/450F/Gas 7.


Place the pepper, chicken, potatoes and kidney beans into a lidded casserole dish. Add the garlic cloves, with their skins still on. Sprinkle over the flour and paprika.


Add the bouillon powder to the water, then mix in the yeast extract until dissolved. Pour this stock mixture into the casserole dish to just cover its contents. Cover the dish with the lid.


Cook the garlic chicken in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. Serve with steamed green beans.
