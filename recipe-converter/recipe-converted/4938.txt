Chilli oil is perfect to give as a homemade edible present for use in salad dressings, stir-fries or on pizzas. Make in small amounts, though, as it doesn't keep for long!






By Mari Williams






Ingredients

450ml/17fl oz olive oil (not virgin)
20g/¾oz dried red chilli flakes
3-4 whole dried red chillies




Method


Gently warm the olive oil in a saucepan. Add the chilli flakes and whole chillies to the oil and heat for 3-4 minutes. Remove from the heat and leave the oil to cool slightly.


When the oil has cooled, carefully strain it into a sterilised, sealable glass bottle using a funnel. Add dried chillies from the pan and seal the bottle.


Keep the bottle in the refrigerator and use within one week.




Recipe Tips
You can use more or less chillies, depending on the heat you require. To sterilise bottles, wash the bottles in very hot water or put them through the hot cycle of a dishwasher. Place the bottles onto a baking tray and slide into an oven set to 160C/325F/Gas 3 for 10-15 minutes. Keep them warm until filled with the oil.
