This Christmas traybake is very quick and easy – much faster than making mince pies. The cooked streusel freezes very well – always serve warm with cream or brandy butter.

50g/1¾oz mixed peel
1 large cooking apple, peeled, cored and roughly chopped
75g/2¾oz butter, cubed
25g/1oz whole blanched almonds, roughly chopped
125g/4oz light muscovado sugar
¼ tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp ground mixed spice
1 lemon, finely grated zest and juice of half a lemon
100ml/3½fl oz brandy, rum or sherry

For the pastry

175g/6oz plain white flour
1½ tbsp icing sugar, sifted
100g/3½oz butter, cubed, plus extra for greasing

For the topping

75g/3oz butter
75g/3oz self-raising white flour
40g/1½oz semolina
40g/1½oz caster sugar

fresh cream or brandy butter




Method


For the mincemeat, place the currants, raisins, sultanas, cranberries, apricots, mixed peel, apple, butter, almonds, sugar, cinnamon, mixed spice, lemon zest and juice into a large pan and cook over a low heat, stirring occasionally for about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, leave to cool, then stir in the brandy, rum or sherry.


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 (fan 180C) and grease a 23x33cm/9x13in Swiss roll tin or equivalent.


For the pastry, sift the flour and icing sugar into a mixing bowl and rub in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs.


Add just sufficient cold water to mix to a firm dough - if you prefer this can be made in a processor. If time allows, wrap the dough in cling film and chill for about 30 minutes.


On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the pastry to a rectangle slightly larger than the prepared tin, then line the base and sides of the tin with pastry.


Trim the pastry level with the top edges of the tin and patch any gaps if necessary.


Spread the mincemeat evenly over the pastry base.


To make the topping, melt the butter and allow this to cool slightly.


Put the remaining ingredients into a bowl and pour the melted butter over. Mix together until the ingredients combine to form a dough. If time allows, chill this mixture - this makes grating easier.


Using a coarse grater, grate the topping over the mincemeat and spread evenly.


Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until golden-brown.


Cut into 16 slices, dust with icing sugar and serve warm with cream or brandy butter.




Recipe Tips
To freeze: store the cooked slices in a plastic container - seal, label and freeze for up to three months.

  To thaw: thaw in the freezer box for four hours at room temperature or overnight.

  To reheat: warm in a preheated oven 150C/300F/Gas 2 for about 20 minutes - dust with icing sugar before serving.
