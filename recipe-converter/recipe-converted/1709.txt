Ingredients

2 heads of cauliflower, cut into florets
150g/5½oz butter
milk, to cover
½ onion
4 cloves
2 bay leaves
salt and pepper
small bunch fresh chives, finely chopped




Method


Gently cook cauliflower in butter for a few minutes to sweat then season well. Barely cover with milk and add the onion, studded with cloves and bay leaves. Simmer until the cauliflower is just soft.


Remove the cauliflower from the milk and purée in a food processor, adding a little of the milk to correct the consistency if necessary. Season and finish with chopped chives.
