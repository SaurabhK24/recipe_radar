Ingredients

100g/3½oz skinless salmon fillet
½ lemon, sliced
6 black peppercorns
1 leek, sliced
1 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp white wine vinegar




Method


Place the salmon in a pan and cover it with water. Add the lemon slices and peppercorns and bring to the boil. Poach for 1 minute and turn off the heat.


Remove the salmon and drain on kitchen paper.


Meanwhile, add the leeks to a small pan and drizzle with the olive oil and vinegar. Cook over a low heat for ten minutes, until the leeks are tender and have lost their bitterness.


Serve the leeks on a warm plate and top with the poached salmon.
