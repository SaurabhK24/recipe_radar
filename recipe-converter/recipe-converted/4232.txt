Ingredients
For the garam masala

1 tbsp cardamom seeds (if you can't buy the seeds then buy cardamom pods and shell them yourself)
1 tsp black peppercorns
1 tsp black cumin seeds (you can use regular cumin seeds if black aren't available)
1 tsp whole cloves
1/3 of a whole nutmeg (you can break a whole nutmeg by placing it on a cloth and bashing it with a meat mallet or rolling pin)
a medium stick of cinnamon, about 5-8cm/2-3 inches, broken up into 3-4 pieces




Method


Put all the ingredients in a clean coffee grinder or other spice grinder and grind as finely as possible.


Store in a tightly lidded jar, away from heat and sunlight and use as needed.
