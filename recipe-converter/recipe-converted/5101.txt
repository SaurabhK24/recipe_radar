You can make these filo parcels in advance and freeze them with the ice cream in them and then just cook them on the day you need them - very handy at this time of year when you're trying to take the hassle out of Christmas preparations

Ingredients

2 bananas, peeled and halved
4 figs, halved
30g/1oz butter, melted
4 sheets filo pastry
icing sugar
4 scoops vanilla ice cream
4 tbsp honey
fresh mint, to garnish




Method


First, cut each sheet of filo pastry in half and overlap them on top of each other.


Brush the filo pastry with the melted butter and add a scoop of vanilla ice cream in the centre.


Bunch up the filo to make a parcel, dust with icing sugar and place in a preheated oven at 220C/425F/Gas 7 for 2-3 minutes.


While the filo parcels are cooking, preheat a griddle pan and brush the bananas and figs with a little of the butter.


Griddle the bananas and figs on both sides and when cooked, place on a plate.


Remove the parcels from the oven and serve on the side of the plate. Drizzle with the honey, a further dusting of icing sugar and garnish with a sprig of mint.
