This super-simple supper is a delicious take on soufflé. It can be made without the bacon for a tasty vegetarian tea.

Ingredients

dash vegetable oil, for greasing
1 medium courgette, trimmed, grated
1 rasher cooked bacon, chopped
1 heaped tbsp plain yoghurt
25g/1oz feta
1 heaped tbsp grated parmesan
pinch ground black pepper
1 free-range egg, beaten
2 tomatoes, sliced, to serve (optional)




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Grease an ovenproof dish with a little oil using a pastry brush. Add the grated courgette, then scatter over the chopped bacon.


In a bowl, mix together the plain yoghurt, feta, parmesan and ground black pepper until well combined. Stir in the beaten egg until well combined.


Pour the egg-and-yoghurt mixture on top of the courgette and bacon mixture. Transfer the dish to the oven and bake for 20–25 minutes, or until the egg-and-yoghurt mixture has set and is golden-brown on top.


Remove the dish from the oven and set aside to cool slightly. Serve with the sliced tomatoes, if desired.
