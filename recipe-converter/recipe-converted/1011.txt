Ingredients
For the salad

50g/2oz goats' cheese, sliced from a 'log'
olive oil, for drizzling
salt and freshly ground black pepper
½ lemon, juice only
large handful each of chervil, basil, parsley

For the potato rösti

¼ large potato, peeled, grated
25g/1oz butter
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the salad, drizzle the goats' cheese with the olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a frying pan, add the goats' cheese and fry for 1-2 minutes on each side until golden-brown.


Mix the lemon juice, a drizzle of olive oil, salt and freshly ground black pepper in a bowl and add the herbs, tossing well to coat evenly.


For the potato rösti, grate the potato into a dry clean tea towel and squeeze out the excess water. Melt the butter in a small frying pan, add the grated potato and press down with a spatula or palette knife. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fry until golden-brown on both sides, turning carefully.


To serve, pile the herb salad onto a serving plate, place the potato rösti next to the salad and top with the warm goats' cheese.
