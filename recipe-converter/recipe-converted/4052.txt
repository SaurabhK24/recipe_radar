Ingredients

Up to 250g/9oz streaky bacon, diced
2 tbsp olive oil
1 large onion, finely chopped
up to 250g/9oz cooked sausages, roughly chopped
up to 250g/9oz piece butcher's black pudding, chopped roughly or crumbled
500g/1lb2oz cooked basmati or other long grain rice
salt, freshly ground black pepper




Method


In a large pan gently fry the bacon until starting to crisp a little. Add the onion and sweat until soft, golden and translucent. Add the sausage pieces and black pudding and turn up the heat a little so they both crisp up and the onions start to take a little colour (you can burn them brown, but don't burn them black).


Throw in the rice and heat through, tossing the pan occasionally until everything is well mixed and nicely hot. Taste and season as you like with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Serve at once.
