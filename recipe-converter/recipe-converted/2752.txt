Ingredients

1 tbsp cumin seeds
1 tbsp coriander seeds
1 tbsp fennel seeds
1 tsp black peppercorns
½ beef stock cube
2 tsp salt
2 tsp sugar
90g/3¼oz butter
1 tsp sesame oil
½ garlic clove
300g/10½oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting




Method


Preheat oven to 210C/425F/Gas 7. Line a baking tray with non-stick parchment.


Grind the spices in a pestle and mortar to a coarse powder, then transfer to a food processor and blend with the stock cube, salt and sugar.


Melt the butter together with 90ml/3¼fl oz water and the sesame oil. Pour the mixture into a bowl and stir in the spices and garlic. Finally add the flour and mix well to combine.


Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to a ½cm/¼in thickness, prick evenly all over with a fork, and cut out in 5cm/2in circles. Transfer the crackers to the lined baking tray.


Bake for 9-12 minutes until golden-brown and crisp.
