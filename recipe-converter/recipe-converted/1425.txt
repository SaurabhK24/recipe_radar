Ingredients
For the burger

¼ red onion, finely chopped
150g/5½oz minced beef
salt and freshly ground black pepper
50g/2oz mozzarella
1 tbsp olive oil

For the courgette fries

½ courgette, cut into matchsticks
100ml/3½fl oz milk
50g/2oz flour
250ml/9fl oz vegetable oil




Method


In a bowl, mix the red onion with the minced beef and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Shape the mince into a burger, then insert the mozzarella into the middle of the burger.


Heat a non-stick frying pan. Add the oil and cook the burger for 4-5 minutes on each side, or until cooked through.


Take off the heat and leave to rest for 3 minutes.


Make the courgette fries. Dip the courgettes in the milk, then coat the courgettes in flour.


Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. It is ready when a breadcrumb that is dropped in will sizzle gently in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Place the courgettes in the hot oil and deep fry for 4 minutes until golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towels.


To serve place the burger on a plate and serve the courgette fries on the side.
