Method


Trim the monkfish, then cut into medallions about 2.5cm/1in thick. Season with a little salt and press each medallion lightly into the cracked pepper to coat. Place in the refrigerator.


To make the sauce, heat the oil in a frying pan, add the shallot and garlic and saut√© for 3 minutes. Add the wine and cook until evaporated. Stir in the cream and bring to the boil, then add the mustard, dill and seasoning. Reduce the heat and keep warm.


Wipe out the pan with kitchen paper. Heat the oil for frying until very hot, add the monkfish medallions and cook for about 2 minutes on each side until browned and just firm when pressed. Remove and drain on kitchen paper.


Place the medallions on 4 warmed serving plates and spoon the sauce around
