Almost embarrassingly easy and great to make with kids, this coconut macaroon is a dainty treat packed with flavour. And gluten-free!

Ingredients

2 egg whites
100g/3½oz caster sugar
160g/5½oz desiccated coconut
1 tsp grated lime zest
1 tbsp lime juice




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/355F/Gas 4.


Use your hands to mulch the egg whites, sugar, coconut, lime zest and juice in a bowl until they lightly come together.


With wet hands, press the mixture into a flat, square shape about 1cm/0.5in high.


Use a small upturned liqueur glass to cut out small rounds, and place on a lightly oiled or nonstick baking tray.


Bake for 12-15 minutes in the centre of the oven until very lightly golden, just touched with colour.


Cool the macaroons on a wire rack, and store in an airtight jar.
