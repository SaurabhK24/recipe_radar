Ingredients

500g/1Ib 2oz small currants
140g/5oz raisins
140g/5oz mixed peel
500ml/17fl oz bottle strong bottled beer, such as Black Sheep Brewery Riggwelter Strong Ale
180g/7oz soft dark brown sugar
150g/5½oz self-raising flour
180g/7oz wholemeal self-raising flour
3 tsp mixed spice
3 free-range eggs




Method


Put the dried fruit into a large pan and cover with the bottled beer.


Gently heat the fruit until the beer is hot, but not boiling. Remove from the heat, cover and leave overnight.


When you are ready to cook the loaf, preheat the oven to 140C/275F/Gas 1.


Add the sugar, flours, mixed spice and eggs to the fruit mixture. Stir well until all the ingredients are combined.


Divide the mixture between two greased 500g/1Ib 2oz loaf tins.


Bake for 1¼ hours until risen, pale brown and firm to the touch.


Cover with a tea towel and leave on a wire rack to cool.


Wrap the loaves tightly in cling film and keep in a cool, dry place for up to 6 weeks. This loaf is delicious buttered with raspberry jam or served with a piece of Wensleydale cheese.
