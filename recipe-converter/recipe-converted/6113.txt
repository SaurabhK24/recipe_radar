Ingredients

300g/10½oz self-raising flour
100g/3½oz medium oatmeal, plus extra for dusting
100g/3½oz wholemeal flour
50g/2oz caster sugar
2 tsp baking powder
½ tsp salt
160g/5½oz unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing
100g/3½oz walnuts, roughly chopped
125ml/4fl oz buttermilk
150ml/5fl oz maple syrup




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 4.


Mix the self-raising flour, oatmeal, wholemeal flour, caster sugar, baking powder and the salt in a bowl to combine.


Add the butter and rub into the flour mixture until it resembles breadcrumbs.


Fold in the walnuts.


Place the buttermilk and maple syrup into a separate bowl and mix well.


Add the buttermilk and maple syrup mixture to the dry mixture and mix well to make a dough.


Roll the dough out on a floured work surface to 3cm/1½in thick. Using a pastry cutter, cut out 12 scones (or as many as the dough will provide).


Place onto a greased baking tray and transfer to the oven to bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden-brown.


Eat while still warm from the oven.
