freshly ground black pepper

For the lentils

100g/3½oz tinned lentils, drained

For the lamb, place the garlic and salt into a pestle and mortar or small bowl and crush together to make a paste. Stir in the olive oil, rub the mixture over the lamb and leave to marinate for five minutes.


Heat a griddle pan and chargrill the lamb for 4-5 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking. Season with freshly ground black pepper and set aside to keep warm.
