Ingredients

25g/1oz butter
3 tbsp honey
50ml/2fl oz double cream
1 fresh fig, halved
Greek-style yoghurt, to serve




Method


Melt the butter and honey together in a small frying pan over a medium heat. When the mixture starts to turn brown and caramelise, stir in the cream and reduce the heat.


Place the fig halves in the pan, spooning over the sauce, for about 3-4 minutes, or until the fig is tender.


Place the honeyed fig onto a serving plate and serve with a dollop of Greek-style yoghurt.
