Ingredients

3 free-range egg whites
3 tbsp caster sugar
1 tsp cornflour
3 free-range egg yolks
30g/1oz fudge, crumbled
6-8 raspberries, to decorate




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Place the egg whites into a clean bowl and whisk, gradually adding the caster sugar and cornflour until the mixture forms stiff, glossy peaks, when the whisk is removed.


Place the egg yolks into a separate bowl and whisk. Then stir in the fudge and raspberries.


Gently fold the egg whites into the egg white and fudge mixture and stir to combine.


Transfer the egg mixture into a flameproof saucepan, and place into the oven to cook for six to eight minutes or until well risen and golden.


To serve, serve the soufflé in the saucepan and dust with the icing sugar.
