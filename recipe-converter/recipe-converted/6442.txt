Ingredients
For the salad

1 x 400g tin mixed bean salad, drained and rinsed
2 spring onions, finely chopped
2 celery sticks, thinly sliced
1 large tomato, deseeded and finely diced
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the dressing

3 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp white wine vinegar
1 tsp sugar
2 tsp Dijon mustard
1 tbsp chopped fresh tarragon
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley




Method


Put all the salad ingredients in a bowl and mix well.


Mix the dressing ingredients in a separate bowl or jug until well combined.


Pour the dressing over the salad, season well with salt and pepper and toss together.




Recipe Tips
The salad will keep, covered, in the fridge for 2–3 days, in fact this will allow the flavours to develop.
