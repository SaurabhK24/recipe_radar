Ingredients
For the potatoes

150g/5½oz potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes
1 tbsp olive oil
1 sprig fresh rosemary

For the fish

small handful fresh flatleaf parsley
small handful fresh coriander
2 slices white bread
1 tbsp olive oil
150g/5½oz cod loin




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the potatoes, bring a pot of salted water to the boil, add the potatoes and simmer for five minutes. Drain.


Heat the olive oil in a small non-stick frying pan and sauté the potatoes with the rosemary for ten minutes, or until golden and tender.


For the fish, place the herbs and bread into a small food processor and pulse to make breadcrumbs. Roll the fish in the crumbs to coat well.


Heat the olive oil in a small non-stick ovenproof frying pan and fry the fish for two minutes on each side, or until crisp and golden.


Transfer to the oven for a further 4-5 minutes, or until cooked through.


Serve the fish on top of the sauteéd potatoes.
