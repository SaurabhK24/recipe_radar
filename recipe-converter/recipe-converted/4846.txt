Ingredients

50g/2oz caster sugar
100g hazelnuts, chopped




Method


Place the sugar and nuts into a saucepan over a medium heat and caramelise gently, stirring to coat the hazelnuts.


Once browned, pour the mixture out onto a non-stick baking sheet, spread out and leave to cool. Once cooled and set, smash the praline into pieces with a toffee hammer or a rolling pin.
