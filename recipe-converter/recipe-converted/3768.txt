Feed a crowd with this classic nursery pudding. Cook it in two large deep roasting tins if you don't have a big enough dish.

Ingredients

40 large Bramley apples, peeled, cored and sliced
1kg/2lb 4oz unsalted butter, softened
550g/1lb 4oz brown sugar
150ml/5fl oz golden syrup
1 tbsp ground cinnamon
700g/1lb 10oz raisins
20 eggs
1kg/2lb 4oz self-raising flour




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Grease a very large ovenproof serving dish with 125g/4oz of the butter then scatter in the apple slices. Sprinkle over 150g/5½oz of the brown sugar, the golden syrup, cinnamon and finally the raisins.


In a mixing bowl, beat together the remaining butter and sugar in a large mixer (or with a wooden spoon) until pale and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then use a large metal spoon to gently fold in the flour.


Spoon the batter over the apples and gently even out with the back of the spoon.


Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until golden-brown and cooked through. Serve with custard.
