Ingredients
For the poached apricots

250ml/8¾fl oz white wine
1 orange, halved
vanilla pod
55g/2oz caster sugar
1 apricot, halved and stone removed

For the syllabub

284ml/½ pint double cream
2 tbsp icing sugar
½ vanilla pod, seeds only
1 lemon, juice and zest only
2 fresh mint sprigs, to garnish




Method


For the apricots, heat the wine in a deep saucepan to reduce slightly for 3-4 minutes. Squeeze over the orange juice and add the squeezed orange halves to the pan.


Using a sharp knife, scrape the seeds out of the vanilla pod. Set aside half of the seeds and add the pod and half the seeds to the pan.


Add the sugar and let it dissolve then add the apricot halves. Simmer for five minutes, then take the pan off the heat and allow the apricots to cool.


Meanwhile, for the syllabub, whisk together the double cream with the reserved vanilla seeds until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the cream.


Add the juice and zest of the lemon and the icing sugar. Fold together gently.


Spoon the cream mixture into two tall dessert glasses and top each with a sprig of mint and half a poached apricot.
