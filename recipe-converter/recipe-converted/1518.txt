These cute little cakes on a stick are really easy to make and delicious too!






By Simon Rimmer


From Something for the Weekend






Ingredients

100g/3½oz dark chocolate
125g/4½oz fruit cake
125g/4½oz Madeira cake
2 tbsp desiccated coconut
2 tbsp chopped hazelnuts

To decorate

300g/10½oz white chocolate
few drops food colouring
multi-coloured sugar ball sprinkles




Method


Melt the chocolate in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water. (Do not let the base of the bowl touch the water.)


Crumble the fruit cake and Madeira cake into a bowl, then stir in the melted chocolate, desiccated coconut and hazelnuts until well combined.


Roll golf ball sized pieces of the mixture into balls. Stick a lollipop stick into each ball and set aside in the fridge for 20-30 minutes, or until firm.


Meanwhile, melt the white chocolate in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water. (Do not let the base of the bowl touch the water.) Stir in the food colouring.


Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Sprinkle the sugar sprinkles onto a plate.


Remove the balls from the fridge, dip them into the chocolate, then coat in the sugar sprinkles and place onto the baking tray. Set aside in the fridge for 20-30 minutes, or until the chocolate has set.




Recipe Tips
For a prettier finish, stick the lollipops into a piece of styrofoam to set.
