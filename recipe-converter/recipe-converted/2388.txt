Ingredients
For the roulade

5 free-range egg whites
110g/4oz icing sugar, plus 1 tbsp for the filling
40g/1½oz caster sugar
2 tsp cornflour, sieved
1 tbsp cocoa powder
400ml/14fl oz double cream
1 vanilla pod, split, seeds scraped out
150ml/5fl oz raspberries, puréed
200g/7oz dried cranberries

To serve

icing sugar
cocoa powder
raspberries
chocolate sauce




Method


Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2. Grease and line a 33cm x28cm/15in x11in Swiss roll tin with silicone or greaseproof paper.


Place the egg whites into a bowl and whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl. Gradually add the sugars until stiff peaks forms and the mixture is glossy. Whisk in the cornflour and cocoa until well combined.


Spoon the mixture into the tin and gently smooth the surface with a palette knife. Bake in the oven for one hour. Test by pushing a skewer into the centre of the cake. If the skewer comes out clean, the cake is ready.


Whisk the whipped cream, icing sugar and vanilla seeds in a bowl until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed.


Dust a large piece of greaseproof paper with icing sugar.


Turn the roulade out onto the paper and peel off the lining paper. Trim the two long edges.


Spoon over the raspberry purée, then the cream and finally the cranberries. Roll up using the sheet of greaseproof paper to help you lift the meringue. Place the roulade onto a plate and dust with the icing sugar and cocoa powder.


To serve, slice the roulade into thick pieces and serve with the raspberries and chocolate sauce.
