Ingredients
For the deep-fried onion rings

500ml/18fl oz vegetable oil, for deep frying
75g/2½oz plain flour
75g/2½oz self-raising flour
salt and freshly ground black pepper
100ml/3½fl oz sparkling water
1 red onion, peeled, cut into thick rings

For the watercress mustard salad

1 tbsp wholegrain mustard
1 tbsp Dijon mustard
2 tbsp white wine vinegar
100ml/3½fl oz extra virgin olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
100g/3½oz watercress




Method


For the onion rings, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Place both types of flour into a large bowl, season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper and whisk in enough sparkling water to make a batter the consistency of single cream - you may not need it all.


Dip the onion rings into the batter then carefully place them into the hot oil to deep fry for 4-5 minutes, or until golden-brown. Remove the onion rings from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


For the salad, place the mustards, vinegar and olive oil into a large bowl, season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix well. Add the watercress to the bowl and stir to coat.


To serve, place the salad onto a large plate with the onion rings on top.
