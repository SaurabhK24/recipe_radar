These quick pickled mushrooms would be delicious served as part of an antipasto with cured meat, olives and Italian cheeses.

Ingredients

1 litre/1¾ pints white wine vinegar
1 tsp salt
1 tsp sugar
2 garlic cloves
olive oil
½ tsp black peppercorns
1 bay leaf
1 kg/2lb 4oz wild mushrooms, cleaned and roughly chopped




Method


Place all of the ingredients except the mushrooms into a saucepan and add 500ml/18fl oz water.


Bring to the boil and add the mushrooms. Cook for 12-15 minutes, or until cooked through.


Remove the mushrooms from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside to dry on a clean tea towel for 3-4 hours, or until completely dry.


Pour some olive oil into a 1 litre/1¾ pints sterilised jar, add the mushrooms, then cover with more olive oil. Stir together gently until all of the mushrooms are coated in the olive oil. Cover tightly with a sterilised lid.


The mushrooms will keep for two months unopened. Use within 3-4 days once opened.




Recipe Tips
To sterilise the jar, wash in very hot water or on the hot cycle of a dishwasher. Preheat the oven to 160C/325F/Gas 3. Place the jar upside down on a baking tray and dry in the oven for 10-15 minutes.
