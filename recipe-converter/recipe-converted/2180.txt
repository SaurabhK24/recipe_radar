By Brian Turner






Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
½ onion, diced
100g/3½oz boneless chicken thighs, diced
1 tsp curry powder
pinch of chilli powder
½ tsp turmeric
70g/2½oz peas




Method


Heat the oil in a pan and fry the onion for a few minutes, to soften. Add the chicken and fry until the chicken is browned all over.


Add the curry powder, chilli powder and turmeric and stir to coat the chicken in the spices.


Stir in the peas and 70ml/2½fl oz water. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 10-12 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.


Remove from the heat and serve with boiled basmati rice, naan bread and any pickles or chutneys you have to hand.




Recipe Tips
Chicken thighs are full of flavour and cheaper than chicken breasts, making them perfect for cooking tasty chicken dishes on a budget.
