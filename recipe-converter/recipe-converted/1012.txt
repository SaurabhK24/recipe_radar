Ingredients
For the chutney

1 tbsp olive oil
½ tsp dried chilli flakes
1 tsp white wine vinegar
1 tsp caster sugar
25g/1oz green grapes
25g/1oz red grapes

For the warm goats' cheese

1 tbsp olive oil
75g/2¾oz goats' cheese, from a cylander cut into three rounds
25g/1oz rocket to garnish
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


To make the chutney, heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the chilli flakes, vinegar and sugar and fry for one minute.


Add the grapes and cook for five minutes, until the grapes are beginning to break down and soften.


For the warm goats' cheese, heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the goats' cheese rounds and gently fry for five minutes on each side until browned.


To serve, place the three cooked goats' cheese rounds into the centre of the plate. Garnish with rocket in the middle and spoon the grape chutney around.
