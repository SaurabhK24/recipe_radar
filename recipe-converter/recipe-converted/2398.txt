Freshly baked scones are easily on the podium of teatime treats, but this twist with chocolate and orange is pure gold.

Ingredients

700g/1lb 9oz self-raising flour
150g/5½oz butter
150g/5½oz caster sugar
2 large oranges, finely grated zest of both and juice of one orange
150g/5½oz chocolate drops
200ml/7fl oz whole milk, plus extra for brushing

To serve

clotted cream
2 satsumas




Method


Preheat the oven to 210C/400F/Gas 6. Lightly butter two baking trays.


Sift the flour into a bowl. Rub in the butter using your hands until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar, chocolate drops and orange zest.


In a measuring jug, mix the milk with the juice of one orange. Add to the flour mixture gradually until the dough just comes together. You may not need all the liquid. Be careful not to overwork the scone dough.


Roll out the dough to approximately 2cm/1in thickness and cut out scones using a 5-6cm/2-2½in cutter.


Transfer the scones to the buttered baking trays, brush the tops with milk and bake in the centre of the oven for 10-12 minutes, or until risen and golden-brown.


Remove from the oven and cool on wire rack. Serve with clotted cream and satsumas.
