Ingredients
For the prawns

½ bunch coriander, finely chopped
3 tbsp olive oil
16 cooked prawns, peeled but tails left on
200g/7oz ready-made kadaifi pastry (also spelled 'kataifi'; available at some continental delicatessens and online specialists)
vegetable oil, for deep frying

For the salsa

1 small red onion, finely chopped
2 tomatoes, peeled, seeds removed, finely chopped
2 preserved lemons, skin only, drained and finely chopped
1 tbsp harissa paste
½ lemon, juice only
½ bunch fresh coriander, finely chopped
Rocket to serve




Method


For the prawns, pound the coriander and olive oil together in a pestle and mortar until the mixture is the consistency of pesto. Dip the prawns in the coriander to coat.


Unravel the pastry onto a flat, clean work surface. Cut the pastry into 12 equal pieces about 10cm/4in (keep the pastry pieces covered after you've cut them out to prevent them from drying out). Wrap the pastry pieces around the prawns.


Heat a deep fat fryer to 170C/325F/Gas 3, or until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Deep fry the prawns in batches until golden-brown. Remove with a slotted spoon, drain on kitchen paper and keep in a warm place until ready to serve.


For the salsa, combine all of the salsa ingredients. Leave to stand for about 15 minutes to let the flavours infuse before serving.


Serve the prawns with the salsa on the side.
