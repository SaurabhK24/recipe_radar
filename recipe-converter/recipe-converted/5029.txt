Ingredients
For the baked feta

100g/3½oz feta cheese
2 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only
3 tbsp olive oil
½ tsp chilli flakes

For the olive tapenade

100g/3½oz pitted black olives
1 garlic clove, chopped
4 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
2 tbsp olive oil

For the baba ganoush

½ aubergine
2 tbsp olive oil
100ml/3¾fl oz Greek yoghurt
1 garlic clove, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/390F/Gas 6.


For the baked feta, place the feta on a baking tray. Drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with the thyme leaves and chilli flakes.


Cook in the oven for five minutes, or until golden.


For the olive tapenade, place the black olives, garlic and chopped parsley into a mini food processor. Add half of the olive oil and blend. Continue adding the olive oil until you have a smooth paste - you may not need to use all four tablespoons of the oil.


For the baba ganoush, place the aubergine on a baking tray and drizzle with the olive oil. Cook in the oven for 10-12 minutes, or until soft.


Remove the aubergine from the oven. Peel away the aubergine skin and discard.


Place the aubergine flesh into a mini food processor and blend. Add the Greek yoghurt and garlic and season and blend again.


To serve, place the baked feta on a serving plate. Drizzle with the tapenade and seve the baba ganoush alongside.
