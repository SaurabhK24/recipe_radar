Ingredients
For the duck

1.8kg/4lb duck, spatchcocked (backbone removed, duck flattened out)
2 tbsp tamarind paste
1 tbsp honey
1 tsp ground coriander
½ tsp ground turmeric

For the salad

4 pak choi, quartered
2 mangoes, peeled, stone removed, cut into thick slices
150g/5oz beansprouts
1 tbsp sesame oil
2 tbsp soy sauce
½ tsp tamarind paste
½ tsp fresh ginger, peeled, grated
4 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 230C/445F/Gas 8.


For the duck, place the duck flesh-side down onto a large baking tray.


Whisk the tamarind, honey, ground coriander and turmeric together in a bowl.


Brush the skin of the duck with the honey and spice mixture, to completely cover.


Roast the duck in the oven for 40-50 minutes (for medium rare), or until cooked to your liking, then remove and leave to rest for ten minutes.


For the salad, heat a griddle pan until hot.


Bring a pan of salted water to the boil, then add the pak choi and boil for one minute. Drain the pak choi then place onto the griddle pan and cook until charred on all sides. Remove and place into a serving bowl.


Place the mango slices onto the griddle and cook, turning once, until charred on both sides. Place into the bowl with the pak choi. Add the beansprouts and mix gently.


Whisk the sesame oil, soy sauce, tamarind and ginger together in a separate bowl, then drizzle over the salad. Mix well.


To serve, carve the duck and place equal portions onto each plate. Place some salad alongside and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.
