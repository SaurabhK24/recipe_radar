Ingredients

120g/4Â½oz baby broad beans, pods removed (podded weight)
55g/2oz very finely sliced pata negra or similar high-quality Spanish cured ham, torn (the slices will be so thin that it should result in small shavings of ham)
1 small garlic clove, peeled, finely chopped
1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
splash sherry vinegar
sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Cook the podded broad beans in a pan of boiling, salted water for 2-3 minutes, or until tender. Drain well, then refresh in cold water. When cool enough to handle, peel away the outer membranes.


In a bowl, mix together the cooked broad beans, pieces of pata negra ham and chopped garlic until well combined.


Drizzle over the olive oil and a splash of sherry vinegar, then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir well. (NB: Remember that the cured ham will be salty.) Serve immediately.
