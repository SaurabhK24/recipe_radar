Ingredients

2 tbsp plain flour
salt and freshly ground black pepper
800g/1lb 12oz venison shoulder, cubed
vegetable oil, for frying
2 onions, peeled, sliced
1 tbsp smoked paprika
1 garlic clove, peeled, crushed
2 tbsp chopped jalapeno peppers, from a jar
150ml/5Â½fl oz soured cream
200ml/7fl oz hot beef or game stock

To serve

1-2 spring onions, finely chopped
steamed rice




Method


Season the flour with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Dredge the venison cubes in the seasoned flour until completely covered, then shake off any excess.


Heat 3-4 tablespoons of the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the venison cubes, in batches, and fry for 4-5 minutes, or until browned on all sides. Remove from the pan and set aside. Keep warm. Repeat the process with the remaining venison cubes.


Add the onions to the pan the venison cubes were cooked in and fry for 6-8 minutes, or until softened and golden-brown.


Stir in the smoked paprika, garlic and chillies and fry for a further 3-4 minutes.


Return the venison to the pan, then pour over the soured cream and stock, stirring well to combine. Bring the mixture to the boil, then reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering and continue to simmer for one hour, or until the sauce has thickened.


To serve, spoon the rice onto six serving plates. Spoon the goulash alongside. Sprinkle over the spring onions.
