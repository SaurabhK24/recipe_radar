Ingredients
For the curry paste

½ red pepper
½ tsp mild curry powder
½ tsp coriander
2 garlic cloves
2 tbsp vegetable oil

For the noodles

200g/7oz egg noodles, cooked according to packet instructions
1 tbsp sesame oil

For the broth

55g/2oz cashew nuts
5 asparagus spears, woody stems only
½ red pepper, chopped
250ml/9fl oz chicken or vegetable stock
100ml/3½fl oz double cream
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander

To serve

sprigs fresh coriander
sprigs fresh chives




Method


For the curry paste, place all of the paste ingredients into a small food processor and blend to a smooth paste.


For the noodles, mix half of the curry paste with the cooked drained egg noodles and sesame oil.


For the broth, dry fry the cashew nuts in a frying pan for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown, then remove and set aside. Add the remaining curry paste to the pan along with the asparagus and red pepper and fry for 3-4 minutes, coating the vegetables evenly in the paste. Stir in the stock and cream and bring to a gentle simmer for 2-3 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Stir in the coriander and the toasted cashews.


Serve the noodles in a soup bowl with the broth spooned over the top, and garnish with the fresh coriander and chives.
