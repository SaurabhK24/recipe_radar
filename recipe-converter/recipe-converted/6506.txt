Ingredients
For the Moroccan spiced kebabs

1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp ground ginger
100g/3½oz rump steak, cut into cubes
salt and freshly ground black pepper
drizzle olive oil

For the charred tomatoes

150g/5½oz fresh cherry tomatoes
1 tbsp caster sugar
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
lime wedges, to garnish




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the kebabs, mix the spices together with salt and freshly ground black pepper and then stir the beef cubes in the spice mix. Thread onto metal skewers, drizzle with oil and then griddle in a hot griddle pan for 2-3 minutes, or until charred on all sides and cooked to your liking.


For the charred tomatoes, stir the tomatoes a hot ovenproof frying pan, add the sugar and toss for two minutes. Place the tomatoes into the preheated oven and cook for 5-6 minutes. Add balsamic vinegar to the pan and stir to coat.


To serve, pile the tomatoes onto a serving plate and place the kebabs on top. Garnish with lime wedges.
