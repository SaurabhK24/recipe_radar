Corn tortillas are made with masa harina (finely ground cornmeal) and are very quick and simple to make. A great accompaniment to many Mexican dishes, they can also be deep fried to make tortilla chips.

Ingredients

150g/5½oz masa harina (available online)
pinch salt
100ml/3½fl oz cold water
1 tbsp olive oil




Method


Mix the masa harina and salt in a bowl. Add the water and olive oil and mix until a smooth dough is achieved. (If it’s too sticky add a little more masa harina, or, if it’s too dry, add a drop more water.)


Divide the dough into 24 balls. Cover and leave to rest in the fridge for 10 minutes.


Flatten the balls of dough with your hands - alternatively, use a tortilla press or roll them between two layers of cling film. Flatten to approximately 3mm thick.


To cook the tortillas, lightly oil a flat griddle pan or frying pan and place over a hot heat.


Cook the tortillas for approximately one minute on each side, or until lightly coloured.
