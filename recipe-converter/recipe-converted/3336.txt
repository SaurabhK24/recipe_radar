Ingredients

1 large egg white
1 tbsp water
fresh pansies, violas or rose petals
55g/2oz superfine caster sugar




Method


In a small bowl, stir together the egg white and water. Grasp the petals with a pair of tweezers and carefully brush the egg mixture onto the petals, lightly coating both sides.


In another bowl, toss the petals with the sugar and transfer to a rack. Allow the petals to dry at least 6 hours, longer if necessary.
