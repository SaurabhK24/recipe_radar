Ingredients
For the toasted stollen

100ml/3½oz double cream
50ml/2fl oz clear honey
100g/3½oz ready-made stollen cake, cut into three slices and toasted
1 tbsp icing sugar, to dust

For the butterscotch sauce

50g/1½oz caster sugar
85g/3oz hazelnuts
½ lemon, juice only
50ml/2fl oz double cream, whipped until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed




Method


For the toasted stollen, mix the cream with the honey in a bowl.


Place one piece of toasted stollen onto a plate. Spoon over some of the honey and cream mixture. Place a second piece of toasted stollen on top and follow with another layer of honey and cream mixture. Top with the last piece of toasted stollen.


Dust the stollen stack with icing sugar.


For the butterscotch sauce, melt the sugar in a frying pan over a medium heat. When the sugar caramelises to a deep golden-brown, add the hazelnuts. Stir to coat the nuts in caramel.


Add the lemon juice and cream and stir to create a thick butterscotch sauce.


To serve, spoon some of the butterscotch sauce around the stollen stack.
