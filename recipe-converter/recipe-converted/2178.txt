Ingredients

150g/5oz dried yellow shi wheat flour noodles, or medium egg noodles
dash toasted sesame oil
300g/11oz skinless chicken breast fillets, sliced into strips
2 tbsp light soy sauce
1 tsp five-spice powder
1 tsp chilli sauce (optional)
1 tbsp cornflour
1-2 tbsp groundnut oil
1 red pepper, seeds removed and finely sliced
150g/5oz bean sprouts
1 spring onion, sliced lengthways
freshly ground black pepper




Method


Cook the noodles in a pan of boiling water for 2-3 minutes until al dente, or according to packet instructions. Drain, then rinse under cold running water and drain again. Drizzle with a dash of sesame oil and toss through to prevent the noodles from sticking to each other.


Put the chicken strips in a bowl and season with a dash of light soy sauce, the five-spice powder and chilli sauce, if using. Mix well, then lightly dust the chicken strips with the cornflour.


Heat a wok until smoking and add the groundnut oil, then add the chicken and stir fry for 3-4 minutes, or until the chicken is golden-brown and cooked through.


Add the red pepper and stir fry for 1 minute, then add the bean sprouts and spring onion and stir fry for 30 seconds. Stir in the cooked noodles and season with the soy sauce, a dash of sesame oil and freshly ground black pepper.


Pile the noodles onto a serving plate and serve immediately.
