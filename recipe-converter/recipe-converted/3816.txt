Ingredients
For the dip

¼ fennel bulb, finely chopped
100g/3½oz Greek yoghurt
¼ lemon, juice only
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the crisps

500ml/18fl oz vegetable oil
50g/2oz new potatoes, finely sliced
sea salt, for sprinkling




Method


For the dip, place all of the dip ingredients into a bowl, mix well and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


For the crisps, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Carefully place the sliced potatoes into the hot oil and cook until golden-brown and crisp. Remove the potatoes from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper, then sprinkle with salt.


To serve, place the crisps onto a plate with the dip in a small bowl alongside.
