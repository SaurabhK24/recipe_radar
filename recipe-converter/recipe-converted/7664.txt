Ingredients

142ml/5fl oz double cream
200ml/8fl oz whole milk
200 g/7oz long grain rice
½ pineapple, peeled and chopped
3 cardamom pods, lightly crushed
2 tbsp soft brown sugar

To serve

15g/½oz butter
4 slices pineapple




Method


Heat the cream and milk in a saucepan over a medium heat and once boiling add the rice. Simmer for five minutes over a low heat.


Add the pineapple and cardamom to the saucepan and simmer gently for ten minutes, adding extra milk to keep the rice covered in liquid if necessary.


Add the brown sugar and continue cooking, stirring continuously, for a further five minutes or until the rice is cooked through.


Meanwhile, heat the butter in a small frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add the pineapple and gently fry the slices for three minutes on each side, or until golden brown.


To serve, spoon the rice pudding into two bowls and place two fried pineapple slices on the top of each.
