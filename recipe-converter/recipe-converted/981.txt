Is it a starter or is it a pudding? In Eastern Europe, cherry soup is traditionally served at the beginning of a meal, but this would also make a great dessert.

Ingredients

900g/2lb cherries, stoned, half the stones reserved
200ml/7fl oz water
200ml/7fl oz red wine
50ml/2fl oz port
1 cinnamon stick
1 strip lemon peel
2 tbsp caster sugar
2 tbsp cherry jam
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, for seasoning
lemon juice, for seasoning




Method


Crush the reserved cherry stones with a hammer or rolling pin and wrap them in a muslin bag. Place all the ingredients apart from the seasonings in a pan with the bag of cherry stones, bring to a boil and simmer for 5-6 minutes.


Remove the pan from the heat and set aside until just warm then remove the bag of cherry stones.


Place the cherry mixture in a food processor and pulse until smooth. Pass the soup through a fine sieve into a bowl. Season with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and lemon juice. The soup is best eaten just warm with a swirl of sour cream on top and a slice of walnut bread alongside.
