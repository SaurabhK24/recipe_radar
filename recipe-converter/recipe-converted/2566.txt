Ingredients

100g/3½oz dark chocolate
250ml/9fl oz double cream
2 oranges, peeled, sliced




Method


Melt half the chocolate in a bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water, then leave to cool slightly.


In a bowl, whip the cream to soft peaks and fold in the melted chocolate to make a marbled effect.


To serve, place the sliced oranges into the base of a glass serving dish, spoon over the chocolate mousse and pour over the rest of the melted chocolate.
