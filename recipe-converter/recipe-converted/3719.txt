Ingredients

1 jar baby artichokes in oil, drained, halved
1 packet puff pastry
1 egg yolk, beaten
smoked paprika (pimenton), for dusting




Method


Preheat oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Cut the pastry into little squares just slightly larger than the artichokes. Brush pastry with beaten egg yolk. Press an artichoke half into the pastry, cut-side up. Dust with smoked paprika. Bake until the pastry is puffed and golden, about 10 minutes. Serve hot as a canapé.
