Ingredients
For the burgers

½ turkey breast
85g/3oz feta cheese
1 handful mixed fresh herbs (parsley, basil and chives)
½ lemon, zest only
1 free-range egg yolk
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp plain flour
2 tbsp olive oil

For the salad

1 lemon, segmented
½ tsp caster sugar
½ tsp chilli flakes
½ tsp salt
1 tbsp chopped fresh mint
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
1 tbsp chopped fresh dill
2 tbsp olive oil

To serve

2 slices white bread, griddled




Method


For the burgers, place all of the burger ingredients, except the flour and oil, in a food processor and pulse until well combined. Using damp hands, shape the mixture into two patties, then dust with the flour.


Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and fry the patties for 3-4 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown and cooked through.


For the salad, combine all of the salad ingredients in a bowl and mix well.


To serve, place one patty on each slice of bread and arrange the salad on top.
