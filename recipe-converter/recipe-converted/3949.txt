Ingredients

600g/1lb 5oz assorted cooked fish (salmon, whiting, pollack)
salt and freshly ground black pepper
100g/3½oz plain flour
2 free-range eggs
100g/3½oz polenta
vegetable oil, for shallow frying

For the tartare sauce

200ml/7fl oz ready-made mayonnaise
1 tbsp English mustard
1 tbsp capers, rinsed and drained
1 tbsp finely chopped gherkins

To serve

4 burger buns
handful rocket
4 lemon wedges




Method


Break up the cooked fish with a fork in a bowl. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Divide the fish mixture into 12 even portions, then mould into finger-shapes about 7.5cm/3in long and 2.5cm/1in thick.


Dredge the fish fingers in the flour, then dip into the beaten egg.


Dip the fish fingers into the polenta to coat completely.


Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the polenta-coated fish fingers and fry for 2-3 minutes, turning regularly, until golden-brown ll over and warmed through.


For the tartare sauce, place all of the tartare sauce ingredients into a bowl and mix well.


To serve, place a spoonful of tartare sauce onto each bun, then add a little rocket.


Top each with three fish fingers and a squeeze of lemon.
