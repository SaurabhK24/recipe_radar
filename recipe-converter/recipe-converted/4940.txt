Ingredients
For the almond-crusted salmon

2 tbsp whole almonds
large handful fresh parsley
50g/1¾oz breadcrumbs
2 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tsp garlic and horseradish mustard
150g/5½oz salmon fillet, skinned

For the chilli spinach

1 tbsp olive oil
2 garlic cloves, sliced
150g/5½oz spinach
pinch chilli flakes
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


To make the salmon crust, place the almonds, parsley, breadcrumbs, a dash of olive oil and seasoning into a blender and pulse to combine.


Spread the garlic and horseradish mustard over the salmon fillet and then roll in the breadcrumbs. Pat to ensure the crumbs stick to the salmon.


Heat the remaining olive oil in a frying pan, add the salmon and pan fry for 3-4 minutes each side.


For the chilli spinach, heat the olive oil in a wok, add the garlic and cook gently for 1-2 minutes. Add the spinach, chilli and seasoning and toss to slightly wilt the spinach. Leave to cool slightly and then squeeze to remove the excess moisture from the spinach


To serve, spoon into a chef's ring, remove the ring and top with the salmon.
