Ingredients
For the floating islands

3 free-range egg whites, whisked until stiff
3 tbsp sugar

For the sesame snaps

2 tbsp soft brown sugar
1 tbsp sesame seeds

For the orange and coconut sauce

1 vanilla pod, seeds scraped out
200ml/7fl oz coconut milk
½ orange, zest only
1-2 tsp sugar
1 orange, sliced, to garnish
fresh mint, to garnish




Method


For the floating islands, place the sugar into a large bowl with the whisked egg whites and whisk together for one minute.


Fill a frying pan with boiling water and bring back to the boil. Use a warmed spoon to place large tablespoonfuls of the meringue mixture onto the surface of the simmering water. Cover with a lid and cook for two minutes, or until poached.


For the sesame snaps, place the brown sugar into a small frying pan over a medium to high heat and heat until melted and golden-brown. Add the sesame seeds to the pan and stir well to combine.


Remove the pan from the heat, spoon the mixture onto a non-stick baking sheet or a sheet of baking paper and spread flat with a wet palette knife. Leave to cool, then break into pieces.


For the orange and coconut sauce, place the vanilla seeds, coconut milk, orange zest and sugar into a saucepan and simmer for 4-5 minutes.


To serve, place the orange slices into the bottom of a soup bowl and pour the sauce over. Place the meringues onto the sauce and garnish with the sesame snaps and fresh mint.
