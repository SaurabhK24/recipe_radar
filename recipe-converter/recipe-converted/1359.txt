Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
1 broccoli head, chopped, main stem discarded
½ onion, chopped
250ml vegetable stock
2 tbsp double cream




Method


Place the olive oil into a medium saucepan over a medium heat. Add the broccoli and onion and fry for two minutes to soften the onion.


Add the stock, bring to the boil and reduce the heat to simmer for eight minutes, until the broccoli has cooked through.


Blend with a hand blender until smooth, then pour into a bowl and serve drizzled with cream.
