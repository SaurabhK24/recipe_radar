Ingredients

½ mango, stone removed
1 pinch chilli flakes
½ lime, juice only
2 tbsp honey




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Score the flesh of the mango in a criss-cross pattern using the tip of a sharp knife. Turn the mango inside out to form a 'hedgehog' shape.


Place the mango on a baking tray and scatter over the chilli flakes, squeeze over the lime juice and drizzle over the honey. Bake for five minutes, or until the mango is lightly caramelised.


Transfer the mango onto a serving plate and serve immediately.
