Served hot or cold, this all-in-one dish tastes as good as it looks. I prefer the vegetables cut into chunky pieces – that way you can taste all the individual ingredients.

Ingredients

2 red onions, cut into quarters and then cut lengthways again
1 large aubergine (the purple Italian variety is best), roughly chopped
2 yellow peppers, deseeded and roughly chopped
2 red peppers, deseeded and roughly chopped
3 courgettes, roughly chopped
1 small fennel bulb, roughly chopped
275ml/½ pint olive oil
1 garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped
black pepper and coarsely ground sea salt
600g/1lb 5oz small new potatoes
450g/1lb baby vine tomatoes
25g/1oz basil, roughly chopped or torn
400g/14oz tin red kidney beans, rinsed and drained
200g/7oz mature cheddar cheese, grated




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


In a large bowl, mix the onions, aubergine, peppers, courgettes and fennel. Pour over the olive oil, add the garlic, and mix thoroughly with your hands.


Transfer the vegetables to a roasting tin. Spread evenly and season to taste with salt and pepper.


Fill a large pan with boiling salted water. Add the new potatoes and cook until just tender. Drain the potatoes and add them to the mixed vegetables.


Place in the hot oven and once the vegetables have started to colour, add the tomatoes, basil and kidney beans. Mix well and return to the oven for a further 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are coloured, but still reasonably crunchy in texture.


Taste and add more salt and pepper, if desired. Serve either hot or cold with grated cheese scattered over.
