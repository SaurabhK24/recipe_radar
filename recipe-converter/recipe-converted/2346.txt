110g/4oz butter
2 tbsp creamed coconut, grated
110g/4oz caster sugar
110g/4oz self-raising flour
2 free-range eggs
½ mango, peeled and roughly diced
½ red chilli, de-seeded and finely chopped




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Grease a six-hole muffin tin with butter.


Blend together the butter, coconut, sugar, flour and eggs in a food processor, until smooth.


Transfer the mixture to a bowl and stir through the mango and chilli.


Divide the mixture evenly into the muffin tin holes and place in the oven for 15 minutes, or until a skewer pushed into a muffin comes out clean.
