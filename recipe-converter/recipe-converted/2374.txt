A deliciously simple pâté you can make in advance. If storing it overnight, cover the surface with a thin layer of melted butter when it’s in the pot. The dressing will keep for a month in the fridge.

Ingredients
For the pâté

1 Arbroath smokies
2 lemons, juice only
150ml/5fl oz double cream
25g/1oz fresh chives, finely chopped
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the dressing

50ml/2fl oz sherry vinegar
50ml/2fl oz red wine vinegar
300ml/10fl oz extra virgin olive oil

For the salad

mixed leaves (baby red chard, lamb’s tongue, watercress, little gem)
2 quails’ eggs, soft-boiled and peeled
300g/10½oz cooked beetroot, sliced
fresh chervil leaves, to garnish




Method


For the pâté, remove the flesh from the fish, discarding all the skin and bones, and place into a blender. Add the lemon juice and blend quickly with the cream to a slightly coarse pâté. Transfer the pâté from the blender to a bowl, add the chives and season to taste with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spoon the pâté into a pot, smooth over the surface and place in the fridge.


To make the dressing, place both the vinegars in a bowl. Whisk in 225ml/8fl oz of the olive oil then check the flavour for balance of oil and acidity, adding more oil if needed.


Shape the pâté into quenelles. Dress the salad leaves with a little of the vinaigrette and cut the eggs in half. Place the beetroot in overlapping circles on a plate, place the salad leaves on top of the beetroot, top with the pâté and the egg and garnish with a few chervil leaves. Serve with slices of warm Melba toast.
