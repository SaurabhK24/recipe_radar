Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
2 onions, finely chopped
2 small red chillies, finely chopped
½ garlic bulb, peeled and crushed
5cm/2in piece ginger root, finely chopped
2 tsp ground coriander
1.5kg/3lb 5oz diced lamb (ask butcher for a mixture of shoulder and leg)
100g/3½oz apricots, chopped
100g/3½oz raisins
½ bottle white wine
½ pint chicken stock (or 2 chicken or vegetable stock cubes with ½ pint of water)
1 tbsp honey
1 tbsp cornflour
handful chopped coriander

To serve

couscous
mixed leaf salad




Method


Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.


Heat the olive oil in a casserole dish and cook the onions for a few minutes until softened, but not coloured.


Stir in the chilli, garlic, ginger and ground coriander, and cook for a further minute.


Add the lamb and cook until the meat is browned.


Add the apricots, raisins, wine, stock and honey. Stir well and bring to the boil.


Transfer to the oven and cook for 1½ hours - alternatively you can simmer it gently on the hob for 1½ hours.


Add a tablespoon of water to the cornflour to form a paste and stir this paste into the lamb.


Cook for a further couple of minutes to thicken, and stir in the chopped coriander. Serve with couscous and a green salad.
