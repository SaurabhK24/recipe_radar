Ingredients

525g/1lb 5oz medium cornmeal, maize flour or polenta
25g/1oz white mooli radish (available from some greengrocers), grated
2 spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped
1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander leaves
salt, to taste
lukewarm water
1 tbsp sunflower oil, for greasing
unsalted butter, to serve




Method


Place all but 25g/1oz of the cornmeal, the mooli, spring onions, coriander and salt into a large bowl and stir to combine. Gradually add the water, a little at a time, until the mixture comes together to make a soft, smooth dough - the quantity of water will depend on the texture of the cornmeal. Knead lightly, then set aside.


Cover a work surface with cling film and sift the remaining 25g/1oz cornmeal evenly over it.


Grease your palms with oil, then divide the dough into 12 lemon-sized balls and flatten them with your hands.


Roll out a piece of flattened dough into a 0.5cm/¼in thick round on the prepared work surface. Repeat the process with the remaining dough.


Heat a griddle or frying pan and cook each piece of dough as you go along. Fry on both sides until slightly puffed up and speckled with brown spots.


Serve immediately, spread with butter, or wrap in aluminium foil for later use.
