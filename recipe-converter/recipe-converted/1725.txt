½ tsp freshly grated nutmeg
150ml/5fl oz milk
150ml/5fl oz double cream
1 clove garlic, finely chopped

Place all the ingredients except the cheese into a large saucepan and heat until the mixture begins to boil.


Pour the mixture into a small buttered gratin dish. Add the cheese to the top of the mixture and bake in the oven for 15 minutes or until bubbling, golden-brown on top and the celeriac is soft.
