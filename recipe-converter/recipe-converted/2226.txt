Stir-fries are a great way to use up small amounts of food in the fridge. Be organised and have all the ingredients ready before you heat the pan, as they will cook very quickly.

Ingredients

2 tbsp groundnut oil
2 skinless free-range chicken breasts, cut into strips
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 tsp grated fresh ginger
1 star anise
½ tsp finely chopped fresh red chilli
handful mangetout
2 pak choi, stems separated
4 spring onions, sliced at an angle
100g/3½oz mixed wild mushrooms, trimmed and cut into even-sized pieces
4 tbsp soy sauce
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
handful fresh flatleaf parsley
1 tbsp chopped fresh tarragon
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives




Method


In a large frying pan or wok, heat the groundnut oil over a medium high heat.


Add the chicken strips and cook, lightly tossing, for 3-4 minutes until the chicken turns white and is almost cooked through.


Add the garlic, ginger, star anise and chilli, and cook for a further 30 seconds.


Add the mangetout, pak choi, spring onions and mushrooms, and stir fry for another 3-4 minutes until they are all lightly cooked.


Finish with the soy sauce, balsamic vinegar and fresh herbs. Stir together briefly and serve immediately.
