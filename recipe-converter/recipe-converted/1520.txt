Ingredients

50g/1¾oz fresh breadcrumbs
100g/3½oz feta cheese, crumbled
1 red chilli, chopped
1 tsp fresh oregano, chopped
1 tsp fresh flatleaf parsley, chopped
2 tbsp olive oil
6 small calamari, cleaned
6 wooden cocktail sticks

For the sauce

1 medium onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 can chopped tomatoes
½ tsp dried oregano
1 tsp sugar
100g/3½oz feta, crumbled, to serve




Method


In a bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, feta, chilli, herbs and olive oil.


Stuff the calamari tubes until two-thirds full. Close the ends with wooden cocktail sticks.


Baste with oil and prick twice. Place on a hot griddle pan and cook until seared on both sides.


To make the tomato sauce, gently fry the onions and garlic before adding the chopped tomatoes, oregano and sugar. Bring to the boil and reduce the heat, simmering until the sauce thickens.


To serve, put the sauce on a serving plate, sprinkle over the feta and place the calamari on top.
