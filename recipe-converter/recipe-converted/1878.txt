Ingredients

½ head broccoli, cut into florets, blanched
3 free-range eggs, separated
2 tbsp cheddar, grated, plus extra for sprinkling
salt and freshly ground black pepper
softened butter, for greasing
flour, for dusting




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and place a baking tray inside to heat.


Place the broccoli into a small blender and blend until finely chopped. Add the egg yolks and blend until combined. Pour into a bowl.


In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed, then carefully fold the egg whites into the blended broccoli.


Fold in the cheese and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Butter two ramekins and dust with flour. Spoon the soufflé mixture into the ramekins. Sprinkle with a little extra grated cheese.


Place the ramekins onto the heated baking tray and place in the oven for eight minutes, or until risen and golden.


Serve straight away, in the ramekins.
