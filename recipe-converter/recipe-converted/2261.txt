Ingredients

4 breast of chicken
1 tbsp runny honey
vegetable oil
salt and black pepper

For the sauce

75ml/2Â½fl oz medium dry white wine
150ml/5fl oz chicken stock
2 sprigs tarragon
150ml/5fl oz double cream
2 tbsp chopped tarragon




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


In a roasting tin, brown the chicken breasts in a little oil. Season both sides, turn skin side up and pour over the honey.


Roast until cooked through - about 20 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan and keep warm while you make the sauce.


Pour off any excess fat, add the wine and bring to the boil, scraping to make sure you include any of the juices from the chicken. Reduce until you're left with a couple of tablespoons of richly flavoured liquid.


Add the stock and the sprigs of tarragon, bring to the boil and reduce by a third.


Stir in the cream, bring to the boil and allow to reduce a little before removing the sprig of tarragon and adding the fresh chopped herb.


Adjust the seasoning and serve spooned over the chicken.
