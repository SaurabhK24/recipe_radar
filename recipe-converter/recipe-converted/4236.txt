Ingredients
For the garlic and lemon thyme chicken

1 whole medium chicken, jointed into 8 pieces
8 tbsp olive oil
8 sprigs lemon thyme
4 garlic cloves, finely sliced

For the salad

500g/1lb 2oz purple sprouting broccoli, trimmed
2 tbsp olive oil
200g/7oz brown cup mushrooms, sliced
1 red onion, sliced
150g/5Â½oz black Spanish olives
1 tbsp sherry vinegar
1 tbsp red wine vinegar
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
2 balls burrata cheese, torn into pieces




Method


Place the chicken pieces, oil, lemon thyme and garlic in a large freezer bag and seal. Leave to marinade in the fridge for at least an hour and ideally overnight.


Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Pour the chicken and its marinade onto a baking tray and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until cooked through.


For the salad, heat a large saucepan of salted water and blanch the broccoli for 2 minutes, remove and drain.


Heat a large griddle pan and drizzle the broccoli with the oil. Place on the griddle pan and cook for 2-3 minutes until charred.


Combine the mushrooms, onion, olives and cooked broccoli in a large bowl. In a small bowl or jug whisk the two vinegars and extra virgin olive oil together to make a dressing.


To serve, pour the dressing over the salad and toss. Place on a serving plate and top with the burrata. Serve the chicken alongside.
