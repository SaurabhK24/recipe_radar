In The Earl I have brought the twin passions of gin and tea together and serve them chilled in a teapot.





By Olly Smith


From Good Food Friday with Michel Roux Jr and Olly Smith






Ingredients
For the Earl Grey infused gin

20g/¾oz loose leaf Earl Grey tea
1 x 750ml bottle gin

For the cocktail

40ml/1½fl oz Earl Grey infused gin
30ml/1fl oz regular gin (not the infused gin)
30ml/1fl oz lemon juice
45ml/1½fl oz elderflower cordial
20ml/1fl oz sugar syrup
1 heaped tsp lime marmalade




Method


Infuse the loose leaf Earl Grey tea into the bottle of gin, shake and leave for exactly 2 hours. Strain and return to the bottle (you will not need all the gin).


Fill a cocktail shaker with ice. Add the Earl Grey infused gin, standard gin, lemon juice, elderflower cordial, sugar syrup and lime marmalade. Shake.


Strain into a teapot packed with ice and serve chilled in teacups with a slice of fresh lemon. You could serve with ice cubes instead of sugar cubes on the side.
