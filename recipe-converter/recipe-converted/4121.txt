Ingredients
For the bean stew

2 tbsp olive oil
200g/7oz cooking chorizo, cut into small chunks
1 tomato, peeled, seeds removed, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, chopped
1 shallot, chopped
110g/4oz roasted peppers (from a jar), thickly sliced
350g/12oz tinned haricot beans, drained
2 sprigs rosemary, finely chopped
4 sprigs thyme, finely chopped
2 tsp sweet smoked paprika
250ml/9fl oz chicken stock
50g/1¾oz unsalted butter
5 tbsp double cream
2 tbsp roughly chopped flatleaf parsley

For the fish

2 tbsp olive oil
1 whole plaice or lemon sole, filleted and pin boned
50g/1¾oz unsalted butter




Method


Heat a large frying pan until medium-hot. Add the olive oil and the chorizo and cook for 5 minutes, or until the oil has changed colour and the chorizo is crisp around the edges.


Add the tomato, garlic and shallot. Gently fry for a minute, then add the peppers, beans, rosemary, thyme and paprika and cook for a further 2 minutes.


Add the stock and bring to a simmer. Cook for 4-5 minutes, or until the shallot has softened and the volume of liquid has reduced slightly. Stir in the butter, cream and parsley. Season, to taste, with plenty of black pepper.


For the fish, heat the oil in a medium frying pan. Once hot, add the fish skin-side down in the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side. Add the butter and baste the fish with it as it melts.


To serve, place the beans in serving bowls and top with the fish.
