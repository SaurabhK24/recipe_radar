Ingredients

450g/16oz crabmeat
1 tsp mustard powder
2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
1 tbsp mayonnaise
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
1 free-range egg yolk
4 tbsp dry breadcrumbs, plus additional breadcrumbs for coating
30g/1oz butter




Method


Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl, except for the coating breadcrumbs and the butter.


Form the mixture into eight individual fishcakes using your hands.


Tip the additional breadcrumbs onto a plate. Dip each fishcake into the breadcrumbs to coat.


Heat the butter in a frying pan and add the fishcakes to the pan - you may need to cook them in batches. Fry them until they're crisp and golden-brown and serve at once.
