150ml/¼ pint cream
2 tbsp caster sugar
½ tsp grated nutmeg
1 vanilla pod, split and seeds removed

To serve

Method


Cut the bread slices into triangles.


Melt the butter in a non-stick frying pan and dip the bread triangles into it to coat.


Brush the bread triangles with the lemon curd.


Place the remaining ingredients in a bowl and whisk together to make a thick batter.


Dip the bread into the batter mixture to coat.


Return the coated bread triangles to the non-stick frying pan and cook in the pan over a gentle heat for 5-8 minutes, until golden and cooked.


Dust with icing sugar and use a mini-blowtorch to caramelise the top.


Place the redcurrants and cream in a bowl and mix together.


Spoon out the redcurrant cream onto plates and serve with the bread and lemon curd pudding.
