Michel Roux Jr. proves that gourmet food can be good to your waistline as well as your taste buds. The fish tartare is best served chilled, not at room temperature.
  Because the fish isn’t cooked make sure you get the freshest, best quality you can. You can also make this dish with bass, mackerel or salmon instead of tuna.

Ingredients

480g/1lb 1oz tuna loin (preferably yellow fin, as fresh as possible)
2 spring onions, thinly sliced
1 medium-hot red chilli, finely chopped
2.5cm/1in piece fresh root ginger, peeled and grated, or finely diced
1 tbsp clear honey
6 tbsp light soy sauce
1 lime, juice only
2 tbsp sesame oil
2 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted
4 slices ciabatta
few sprigs fresh coriander, to garnish




Method


Remove and discard any dark parts from the bloodline of the tuna. Finely dice the remaining tuna and place in a large bowl. Stand the bowl on ice to keep chilled.


Add the spring onions, chilli and ginger to the tuna and mix well.


In a separate bowl mix together the honey, soy sauce, lime juice, sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds.


Toast the slices of ciabatta on a griddle pan.


To serve, press the tuna tartare into a 7cm/3in chef’s ring on each serving plate. Carefully remove the ring, arrange the toast and lime wedges around the tartare.
