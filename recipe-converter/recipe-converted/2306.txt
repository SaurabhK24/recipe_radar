Ingredients

400g/14oz beef rump steaks
4 wholewheat tortillas, cut into 8 wedges
75g/2¾oz baby spinach leaves, washed
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the lime and coriander dressing

15g/½ oz fresh coriander leaves
2 tbsp lime juice
1 tbsp sunflower oil
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 red chilli, finely chopped




Method


Preheat the grill to a hot setting.


Season the beef with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a large frying pan and sear the beef over high heat until it is cooked but still pink. This will take about 2 minutes each side, depending on thickness. Set aside at room temperature.


Grill the tortillas for about 5 minutes, or until they are crispy. Set aside to cool.


Meanwhile, make the dressing by combining all the ingredients in a small bowl.


Thinly slice the beef and arrange it on the spinach leaves. Spoon over the dressing and serve with the warm tortilla wedges.
