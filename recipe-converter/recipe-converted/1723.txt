Ingredients

50g/1¾oz butter, plus extra for greasing
2 onions, finely sliced
1 celeriac, cut into 0.5cm/½in thick slices
500g/1lb 1oz potatoes, cut into 0.5cm/½in thick slices
600ml/1 pint 1 fl oz hot chicken stock (vegetarians can substitute vegetable stock)
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/450F/Gas 6.


Heat a frying pan until hot then add half the butter and all the onions.


Sweat for 3-4 minutes until just softened.


Place a layer of celeriac slices into the bottom of a buttered ovenproof dish.


Top with a layer of onions, then potatoes, then onions again, seasoning with salt and freshly ground black pepper as you go.


Repeat with the remaining celeriac, onions and potatoes, finishing with a layer of potatoes.


Dot with the remaining butter.


Pour over the hot stock so all the layers are covered.


Transfer to the oven and cook for 45-60 minutes, checking occasionally to make sure the stock hasn't completely evaporated, and pressing the layers down with the back of a spoon.


Bake until nearly all the stock is absorbed and the top layer is golden brown.


Serve.
