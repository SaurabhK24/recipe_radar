Ingredients

1 tsp ghee or butter
½ tsp cumin seeds
½ small onion, chopped
½ tsp chopped fresh ginger
1 green chilli, whole (optional)
½ garlic clove, finely chopped
salt, to taste
35g/1¼oz white basmati rice, washed
35g/1¼oz split green lentils
¼ tsp ground turmeric
¼ tsp garam masala
½ tsp freshly ground black pepper




Method


In a large non-stick saucepan melt the ghee. Add the cumin and fry for 20 seconds, until the seeds have coloured and their aroma has been released. Stir in the onion and cook until soft.


When the onion has cooked, add the chilli, ginger, garlic and salt and cook for a minute before adding the rice, lentils, turmeric and 400ml/14fl oz water.


Bring to the boil briefly before lowering the heat and simmering gently until the rice and lentils are tender. This should take 20-25 minutes.


Once tender, stir in the garam masala and pepper and serve.




Recipe Tips
Ghee is clarified butter and is used often in Indian cooking, if you cannot find it regular butter will work well.
