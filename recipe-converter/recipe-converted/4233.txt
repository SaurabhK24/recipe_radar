Ingredients

8oz/225g basmati rice
3 tbsp vegetable oil
1 onion, finely chopped
2 cloves
3 cardamom pods
1 cinnamon stick
½ tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp salt




Method


Wash the rice thoroughly under cold running water and set aside.


Heat the oil in a large pan and fry the onions until golden-brown. Remove and set aside.


While the pan is still hot, add all the spices and cook for 1-2 minutes.


Add the rinsed rice to the pan, along with the salt and 550ml/1 pint of water. Cover and bring to the boil. Add half of the cooked onions and simmer on a low heat for a further 10-15 minutes until the rice is tender.


Serve hot and garnished with the remaining onions.
