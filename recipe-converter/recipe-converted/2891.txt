Ingredients

leftover turkey, chopped
new (waxy) potatoes, ideally Pink Fir Apple or Ratte
½-1 small can anchovies, chopped roughly (according to the amount of turkey you have and how much you like anchovies)
½ clove garlic, crushed to a purée with a fork
few spring onions, or 1 small red onion, sliced finely
olive oil
lemon juice
fresh parsley




Method


Mix the anchovies with the garlic, 1 tbsp of olive oil and a squeeze of lemon.


Toss this mixture with the turkey and onion and leave to macerate while you boil some new potatoes until tender.


Slice the potatoes when still warm and toss immediately with the turkey and some chopped fresh parsley leaves.


Other possible additions include black olives, capers and sun-dried tomatoes.
