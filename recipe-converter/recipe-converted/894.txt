Ingredients

150g/5½oz red cabbage, shredded
1 eating apple, peeled, cored and finely diced
½ small red onion, finely chopped
25g/1oz raisins, soaked in hot water for 10 minutes
½ tsp capers, drained and rinsed
1½ tbsp olive oil, plus extra for frying
½ tbsp red wine vinegar
2 x 150g/5½oz venison loins or steaks
knob of unsalted butter
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.


In a large bowl, mix together the cabbage, apples, onion, raisins and capers.


Mix the oil and vinegar in a clean bowl to make a vinaigrette. Add to the slaw, reserving a little vinaigrette for serving. Season the slaw with salt and pepper, cover and leave to marinate for at least 10 minutes.


Meanwhile, season the venison with salt. Heat a dash of oil and the butter in a large frying pan until foaming. Cook the venison until brown on all sides. Transfer it to the oven for 4 minutes, then leave it to rest.


To serve, mix the parsley into the slaw. Slice the venison. Spoon the slaw onto two plates and top with slices of venison. Finish with the remaining vinaigrette.
