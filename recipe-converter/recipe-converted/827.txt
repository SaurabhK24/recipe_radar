Ingredients

3 tbsp olive oil
1 aubergine, chopped
2.5cm/1in piece fresh root ginger, cut into matchstick pieces
1 onion, roughly chopped
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1 small green chilli, finely sliced
1 tsp ground turmeric
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
1 green pepper, de-seeded, chopped
salt, to taste
400g/14oz tinned tomatoes
2 tsp tomato purée
400g/14oz tinned chickpeas, drained
fresh coriander, chopped, to garnish




Method


Heat the olive oil in a saucepan and lightly fry the chopped aubergines for 2-3 minutes, or until beginning to brown. Add the ginger and fry for 2-3 more minutes, or until the aubergines are golden-brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.


Add the onion to the pan and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until just beginning to soften, then add the garlic, sliced chilli and the ground spices. Lightly fry for 2-3 more minutes, adding a dash of olive oil if the pan is too dry.


Add the green pepper and season with salt, then cover and allow to simmer over low heat for ten minutes.


Return the aubergines to the pan, then stir in the tinned tomatoes, the tomato purée and the drained chickpeas. Lower the heat and allow the mixture to simmer with the lid off for 30-40 minutes, or until thickened.


To serve, spoon the curry into serving bowls and garnish with the chopped fresh coriander.
