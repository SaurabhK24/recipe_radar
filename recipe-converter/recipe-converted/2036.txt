Ingredients

calorie controlled cooking oil spray
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
4 chicken thighs, boned and skinned
1 red pepper, deseeded and cut into 3cm/1in chunks
1 yellow pepper, deseeded and cut into 3cm/1in chunks
1 tbsp cornflour
150g/5½oz fat-free natural yogurt
1 tbsp medium or mild curry powder
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
227g/8oz tin chopped tomatoes
3 heaped tbsp finely chopped fresh coriander, plus extra to garnish
freshly ground black pepper




Method


Spray a large, deep, non-stick frying pan or wok with oil and place over a medium heat. Add the onion and cook for five minutes, stirring regularly until well softened and lightly browned.


Meanwhile, trim all the visible fat off the chicken thighs and cut each one into four pieces. Season to taste.


Add the chicken and peppers to the pan with the onion and cook for three minutes, turning occasionally. Mix the cornflour with 2 tablespoons cold water in a small bowl and stir in the yoghurt until thoroughly mixed.


Sprinkle the curry powder over the chicken and vegetables, add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.


Tip the tomatoes into the pan, add the yoghurt mixture, 150ml/3½fl oz of water and coriander.


Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally until the chicken is tender and the sauce is thick. Season with freshly ground black pepper to taste and garnish with coriander.
