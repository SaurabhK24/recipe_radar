Ingredients
For the potato cakes

250g/9oz ready-made mashed potato
100g/3½oz gruyère cheese, grated
50g/2oz self-raising flour
1 free-range egg
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil
25g/1oz butter

For the tomato salsa

1 lime, juice and zest
1 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
salt and freshly ground black pepper

To serve

3 slices parma ham, fried until crisp

Method


For the potato cakes, place the mashed potato into a bowl with the cheese, flour and egg and mix well. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then shape the mixture into three patties.


Heat the oil and butter in a frying pan and fry the potato cakes for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown.


For the tomato salsa, place all of the salsa ingredients into a bowl and stir to combine.


To serve, place the potato cakes onto a serving plate with the crisp parma ham and poached egg on top and the salsa spooned around the plate.
