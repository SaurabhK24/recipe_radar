This is a nice, simple, inexpensive coconut masala made with whole eggs that are quickly fried before being finished off in the curry.

From Rick Stein's India






Ingredients

3 tbsp mustard oil or vegetable oil
6 free-range eggs, hard-boiled, peeled and left whole
1 tsp ground turmeric
1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
400ml/14fl oz coconut milk
2 medium red onions, very thinly sliced
4cm/1½in fresh root ginger, finely shredded
3 fresh green chillies, thinly sliced, with seeds
½ tsp salt
1 tsp sugar
handful of coriander leaves, chopped
½ tsp garam masala

To serve

boiled basmati rice




Method


Heat the oil in a heavy-based saucepan or karahi over a medium heat, add the whole eggs and fry for 1–2 minutes, or until lightly coloured, then add the turmeric and chilli powder and cook for another 30 seconds. Stir in the coconut milk and bring to a simmer.


Add the onions, ginger, chillies and salt, and simmer for five minutes, or until the coconut milk has reduced in volume by half and the onions are just softened, adding a splash of water if it becomes too thick. Stir in the sugar and coriander and sprinkle with garam masala. Halve the eggs, and serve with rice.
