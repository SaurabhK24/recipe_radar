Ingredients
For the sabayon

4 free-range egg yolks
55g/2oz caster sugar
150ml/¼ pint white wine
150ml/¼ pint double cream, whipped

To serve

1 mango, peeled and sliced
½ lime, zest only
½ orange, zest only
fresh mint sprigs




Method


For the sabayon, place the egg yolks, sugar and wine into a large bowl over a pan of gently simmering water. Whisk with an electric whisk for 15 minutes, or until the mixture is thick. Remove from the heat and continue to whisk until cooled slightly.


Fold the sabayon into the whipped cream in a large bowl.


To serve, fan the mango slices out on a serving plate and pour over the sabayon. Use a mini-blowtorch to glaze the top and garnish with lime and orange zest and mint sprigs.
