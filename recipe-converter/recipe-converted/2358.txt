Ingredients

500ml/18fl oz vegetable oil
1 tbsp olive oil
2 cloves garlic, chopped
½ tsp dried chilli flakes
100g/3½oz chicken breast, chopped
6 Peppadew peppers, chopped
6 French beans, chopped
large handful coriander, chopped
1 lime, juice only
2 ready-made tortilla wraps
2 handfuls fresh parsley
2 limes, cut into quarters, to garnish
½ tsp paprika, to garnish




Method


Heat the oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed pan. It is ready when a breadcrumb that is dropped in will sizzle gently in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and sauté the garlic, chilli and chicken.


Add the peppers, beans and coriander and stir together for a further minute.


Add the lime juice and remove from the heat.


Divide the mixture between the two tortilla wraps, then roll up like a spring roll and secure with toothpicks.


Deep fry the tortillas for two minutes until golden, then remove carefully with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towels. Cut on the diagonal.


To serve, place the parsley on a large plate, add the tortillas and garnish with the lime wedges and a sprinkle of paprika.
