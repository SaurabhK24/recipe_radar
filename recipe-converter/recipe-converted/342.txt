James Martin uses dripping or lard to make his favourite roast potatoes, but duck or goose fat works just as well.

Ingredients

10 large King Edward potatoes, peeled, cut into large chunks
50g/1Â¾oz lard, dripping or vegetable oil
2 pinches sea salt




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Simmer the potatoes in a large pan of salted boiling water for 4-5 minutes, or until the outside of the potatoes are beginning to soften.


Thoroughly drain the potatoes and briefly shake them around in the colander or pan to roughen up the edges.


Melt the lard in a deep flameproof roasting tray on a high heat and fry the potatoes on each side until they begin to brown.


Sprinkle with salt, to taste, and roast for 30 minutes, or until starting to colour.


Turn the potatoes and return to the oven for a further 20-30 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp.




Recipe Tips
You can add extra flavour to the potatoes by adding a few whole garlic cloves and sprigs of thyme or rosemary to the roasting tin before they go in the oven.
