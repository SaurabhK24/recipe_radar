Ingredients

85g/3oz fresh tuna, sliced
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 lime, juice only
1 tbsp clear honey
1 tbsp olive oil
5 radishes, grated
2 tbsp radish leaves, finely chopped
1 tsp caster sugar
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Place the fresh tuna in a bowl with the soy sauce, lime juice and clear honey and leave to marinate for three minutes.


Drain the tuna. Fry the tuna slices in olive oil in a small non-stick frying pan for 1-2 minutes on both sides. Add the marinade for the last minute to warm through.


Place all the remaining ingredients in a serving bowl and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Serve the tuna on top of the salad and drizzle over the juices from the pan.
