Ingredients

1 small carrot, peeled, diced
1 small onion, chopped
2 ripe tomatoes, chopped
1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped
1-2 small handfuls finely chopped fresh coriander
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
¼ tsp ground turmeric
¼ tsp ground cumin
2-4 tbsp rapeseed oil
1 tbsp white wine vinegar
pinch sugar
1 tbsp tomato ketchup
pinch salt
squeeze lemon juice
1 spring onion, trimmed, thinly sliced, to garnish




Method


Put the carrot and onion in a bowl and chop to small pieces using a hand blender.


In a separate bowl, blend the tomatoes and chilli to a smooth purée.


Combine the two mixtures, then stir in the remaining ingredients, adding salt if required. You want the consistency of salsa.


Season the salsa with lemon juice and garnish with spring onion.
