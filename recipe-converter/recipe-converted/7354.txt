Ingredients

8 large egg whites (at room temperature)
pinch of salt
350g/12oz caster sugar
2 tsps/10g cornflour
pinch of cream of tartar
1 tsp/5ml white wine vinegar
4 drops vanilla essence
300ml/½pint double cream, firmly whipped
selection of prepared tropical fruit e.g. mango, pineapple, passion fruit.




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas4. Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Draw a 20cm/8inch circle on the paper.


Whisk the egg whites with half the sugar and the salt in a clean bowl until soft peaks form. Continue beating while adding the remaining sugar until stiff and shiny. Sprinkle over the cornflour, cream of tartar, vinegar and vanilla essence and fold in gently with a metal spoon.


Mould the egg white mix onto the paper within the circle. Flatten the top and smooth the sides. Place in the oven and immediately reduce the heat to 150C/300F/Gas 2 and cook for 1¼ hours.


Turn off the oven, leave the door slightly ajar and allow to cool completely. Invert 'Pav' onto a plate, gently push down the meringue then pile on the cream and dress with the tropical fruit.
