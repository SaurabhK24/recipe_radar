This curry paste is very versatile - you can use it as a dip by mixing it with yoghurt, or as an accompaniment to barbecued fish or vegetables.





By Daniel Green






Ingredients

12 small green chillies
4 cloves garlic
4 shallots
3 stalks lemongrass, tough outer layers removed
thumb-sized piece of ginger, peeled
4 fresh kaffir lime leaves (optional)
1 tsp shrimp paste
salt
freshly ground black pepper




Method


Mix all the ingredients together, either in a food processor or in a large pestle and mortar, until they form a very smooth paste.


The paste needs to be smooth so it does not interfere with the textures and flavours of other ingredients.
