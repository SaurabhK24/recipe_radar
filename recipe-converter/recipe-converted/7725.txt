Great for cooks under five these savoury bacon snacks are easy to whip up for a playtime treat.

  Equipment and preparation: You will need a 6-hole muffin baking tray.



Ingredients

vegetable oil, for greasing
1 egg
50g/2oz plain flour
100ml/3fl oz milk
½ tsp wholegrain mustard
2 closed-cup or small mushrooms
1 rasher of cooked bacon
2 cherry tomatoes




Method


Before cooking, wash your hands and put an apron on. Weigh and measure all the ingredients. Ask a grown-up to preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Oil the muffin tray using a pastry brush and place it onto a baking tray.


Break the egg into a small bowl and beat it with the fork. Place the flour into a mixing bowl, add the egg and stir.


Add the milk to the flour mixture and stir again until you have lots of bubbles and all the flour disappears. This mixture is called a batter.


Add the mustard to the batter. Pour the batter from the mixing bowl into the measuring jug that had the milk in it.


Tear up the mushrooms and divide the pieces between the muffin cups.


Ask a grown-up to help you with using the scissors to cut up the bacon into small pieces. Divide these between the muffin cups, too.


Then chop the tomatoes and share them out between the muffin cups. Finally, pour the batter over the top.


You’ll need to ask a grown-up for help with this part. Put the muffins into the preheated oven for 15–20 minutes, or until brown on top. Once the popovers have cooled down a little, you can eat them!
