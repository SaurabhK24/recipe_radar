olive oil
2 slices white bread, crusts removed, cubed
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the dressing

50g/2oz gorgonzola

Method


For the salad, place the parma ham slices into a hot frying pan and fry for 1-2 minutes until crisp. Remove from the pan and set aside. Add a splash of olive oil to the pan, add the cubed bread, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and fry for three minutes, or until crisp and golden.


For the dressing, place the gorgonzola, oil, lemon juice and a good grinding of black pepper into a food processor and blend until smooth.
