Ingredients
For the stew

2 tbsp vegetable oil
½ onion, peeled, sliced
2 garlic cloves, peeled, crushed
1 tbsp root ginger, peeled, grated
½ tsp curry powder
3 cardamom pods, seeds only, crushed
225g/8oz cooked Puy lentils, drained, rinsed
1 tbsp tomato purée
handful fresh spinach leaves

For the chapattis

200g/7oz chapatti flour, plus extra for dusting
pinch salt
warm water, to bind
1 tbsp black onion seeds




Method


For the stew, heat the vegetable oil in a pan over a medium heat. Fry the onions, garlic and ginger in the oil for 3-4 minutes, to soften.


Add the spices to the pan and stir well. Add the cooked Puy lentils and tomato purée and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until warmed through, stirring occasionally. Stir in the spinach. Set aside.


For the chapattis, mix together the flour, salt and enough warm water to form a dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic.


Divide the dough into 3-4 pieces, each the size of a small apple, and roll out into thin circles with a rolling pin. Scatter over the black onion seeds and press them down into the dough.


One by one, dry fry the rolled-out dough circles in a frying pan on both sides until they start to bubble up and turn golden-brown.


To serve, heat up the stew and serve with the two or more chapattis (keep any leftover chapattis for another meal).
