Ingredients

½ mango, skin left on
½tsp chilli powder
25g/1oz icing sugar
5 tbsp Greek-style yoghurt
1 tbsp honey




Method


Preheat grill to high.


Cut the mango flesh in a crisscross pattern on top. Fold the mango inside out, pressing the skin inwards. This should look like a hedgehog.


Place the mango hedgehog onto an oven-proof sheet and sprinkle with the chilli and dust with the icing sugar.


Place under the hot grill for four minutes until the mango is slightly golden.


Mix the yoghurt and honey together.


Transfer the hedgehog from the grill to a dish and serve with the honey yoghurt mix.
