A few secret ingredients in the homemade barbecue sauce make these tender and juicy spare ribs finger lickin’ good.





By Jenny White






Ingredients

12 pork spare ribs

For the sauce

2 tbsp olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
50g/2oz light muscovado sugar
4 tbsp malt vinegar
3 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
1 tbsp tomato purée
2 tsp Chinese five spice powder
1 tsp ground cumin
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


To make the sauce, heat the oil in a saucepan and add the onion. Fry for 3-4 minutes, until softened, then stir in the rest of the ingredients. Mix well and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened.


Place the ribs on the barbecue and cook for 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the meat. Brush the ribs liberally with the barbecue sauce every few minutes, until they have a thick, sticky coating, and serve.
