Ingredients
For the pancakes

150g/5oz plain flour
1 free-range egg, beaten
150ml/5fl oz milk
pinch salt
1 tbsp olive oil

For the potatoes

8 Anya potatoes, halved
150g/5oz Colleeny cheese or Camembert, cut into cubes
salt and freshly ground black pepper
sprig fresh parsley, to garnish




Method


Bring a pan of salted water to the boil.


For the pancakes, place the flour into a bowl and make a well in the middle of the flour. Add the egg and half of the milk to the well and whisk. Add more milk little by little until the batter has the consistency of thick cream. Add the salt and leave the mixture to rest for five minutes.


Heat the olive oil in a frying pan over a high heat. Add a ladleful of the pancake mixture to the frying pan, swirl the pan so that the mixture is evenly distributed and fry for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until both sides of the pancake are golden-brown. Repeat with the rest of the mixture. Remove each pancake from the pan and place it onto a warm, covered plate, separating each pancake with a sheet of baking paper.


For the potatoes, cook the potatoes in the boiling, salted water for 8-10 minutes, or until tender. Drain well. Add the cheese to the drained, boiled potatoes and stir until it has melted. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, place the pancakes onto a serving plate and pile the cheesy potatoes on top of them. Garnish with fresh parsley.
