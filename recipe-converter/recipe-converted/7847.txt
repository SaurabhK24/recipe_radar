Ingredients

4 ready-cooked poppadums
25g/1oz breadcrumbs
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp plain flour
1 free-range egg, beaten
Â½ chicken breast, skin removed
vegetable oil for shallow frying
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
200g/7oz basmati rice, cooked according to packet instructions with 1tsp turmeric, drained

To serve

1 tbsp chopped fresh chives
Tabasco sauce, to taste




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Blend the poppadums in a food processor until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and sprinkle the mixture onto a plate.


Sprinkle the flour onto a separate plate. Beat the egg in a bowl. Dip the chicken first in the flour, then in the beaten egg and finally in the breadcrumb mixture.


Heat 5cm/2in oil in a deep heavy-based frying pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Fry the chicken in the oil for 4-5 minutes, turning once. Remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and place onto a baking tray. Transfer to the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. (The chicken is cooked through when the juices run clear when pierced in the thickest part with a skewer.)


Stir the chopped coriander into the rice.


To serve, spoon the rice onto a plate and top with the poppadum-crusted chicken. Sprinkle over the chives and add Tabasco sauce, to taste.
