2 tsp plain flour, seasoned with salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp butter, melted
½ lemon
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley, to serve
lemon wedges, to serve

For the butternut squash mash

½ butternut squash, peeled and chopped
50ml/2fl oz double cream

For the spicy curly kale

1 tbsp olive oil
3 spring onions, finely chopped
125g/4½oz curly kale, chopped
3 tbsp white wine

Method


To make the lemon chicken, roll the chicken in the seasoned flour.


Melt the butter in a frying pan, add the floured chicken, squeeze over half the juice from the lemon and cook for 2-3 minutes.


Turn over, squeeze over the rest of the lemon and cook for 2-3 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Remove from the pan and keep warm.


To make the butternut squash mash, boil the squash in salted water until soft.


Drain and blend in a food processor with the double cream, salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Melt the butter in a frying pan, add the blended butternut squash and sauté for 1-2 minutes.


To make the spicy curly kale, heat the olive oil in a sauté pan and add the spring onions.


Cook gently until softened slightly, add the curly kale and cook for another minute, stirring frequently.


Add the white wine, chilli flakes, salt and freshly ground black pepper and leave to cook for 5 minutes or until all the liquid has been absorbed.


To serve, place a pile of butternut squash mash onto a large plate, top with the lemon chicken and spoon the spicy curly kale onto the side. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve with wedges of lemon.
