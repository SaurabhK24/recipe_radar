Ingredients
For the jam

2 tbsp red wine
1 tbsp sugar
2 vanilla pods, seeds only
85g/3oz blueberries

For the cinnamon crusts

25g/1oz butter
2 slices white bread
2 tsp sugar
½ tsp ground cinnamon

To serve

2 tbsp cream




Method


For the blueberry jam, heat the red wine and sugar in a pan until just boiling. Add the vanilla seeds and blueberries and continue to heat until the mixture is reduced and sticky and the berries have burst.


For the cinnamon crusts, heat the butter in a frying pan and gently fry the bread until golden-brown on both sides. Sprinkle over the sugar and cinnamon.


Serve the cinnamon crusts on a serving plate with the blueberry jam and cream drizzled over the top.
