Ingredients

dash olive oil
100g/3½oz Brussels sprouts, halved
½ large potato, chopped and blanched in a pan of boiling salted water for five minutes
pinch turmeric
½ tsp cumin seeds
pinch paprika
1 cardamom pod, crushed
pinch ground cinnamon
2 tbsp white wine
½ chicken stock cube
squeeze orange juice
2 tbsp red wine vinegar
1 tbsp sesame seeds

To serve

large handful coriander, chopped
1 orange, peeled, chopped
2 tbsp plain yoghurt




Method


Put a dash of olive oil in a large saucepan and add the Brussels sprouts and blanched potatoes and cook for about four minutes until browned all over.


Add all the spices and cook for a further two minutes or so, until the spices give off a deep aroma.


Add the white wine, stock cube, orange juice, red wine vinegar and sesame seeds and cook for a couple more minutes. Stir to ensure the stock cube dissolves fully.


In a separate bowl, combine the coriander and orange.


Pour the curry into a serving bowl and top with the mixed coriander and orange. Spoon over the yoghurt just before serving.
