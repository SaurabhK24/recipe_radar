This is no ordinary sandwich: pickled celery mayo with lobster on brioche rolls. Lush. Try with tinned crabmeat as a significantly cheaper alternative.

  Equipment and preparation: you will need a muslin bag and a chef’s mini-blow torch.

Ingredients

1 tsp pickling spices
½ tsp coriander seeds
½ tsp peppercorns
250ml/9fl oz rice vinegar
2 tsp sugar
2 sticks celery, thinly sliced
1 cooked lobster, shell removed, chopped into chunks
1 small sprig tarragon, finely chopped
3 tbsp mayonnaise
lemon juice, to taste
salt and pepper, to taste
2 brioche rolls
butter, to taste
celery leaves, for garnish (optional)




Method


Place the pickling spices, coriander seeds and peppercorns in a muslin bag.


In a saucepan, heat the vinegar, sugar and the bag of spices. Add the celery, bring to a simmer and remove from the heat. Leave the celery to cool.


Mix the lobster, tarragon, mayonnaise and lemon juice together in a bowl. Remove the celery from the pickling ingredients and add it to the bowl. Mix together well and add salt and pepper to taste.


Spread butter on the outer sides of the rolls and toast slightly with the blow-torch.


Split the rolls down the centre and fill with the lobster mayonnaise. Dress with a few celery leaves and serve.
