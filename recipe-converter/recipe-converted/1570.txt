Ingredients
For the caramelised apples

30g/1oz butter
1 apple, peeled, cored and cut into wedges
2 tbsp clear honey

For the almond brittle

200g/7oz caster sugar
100g/3½oz almonds, roughly chopped

To serve

2 slices brioche, griddled
icing sugar, to dust




Method


For the caramelised apples, melt the butter in a frying pan, add the apples and honey and sauté until golden-brown.


For the brittle, place the sugar into a frying pan and leave to melt over a low heat, shaking the pan from time to time, but not stirring. When all the sugar has dissolved and the liquid turns golden-brown, add the almonds and then pour onto a non-stick mat. Leave to cool and then break up into pieces.


To serve, place the griddled brioche onto a serving plate and top with the caramelised apples and almond brittle. Dust with icing sugar.
