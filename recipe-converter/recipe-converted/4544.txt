Ingredients
For the frittatas

8 free-range eggs
350ml/12fl oz double cream
2 tbsp each of parsley and chives
3 spring onions, very finely sliced
110g/4oz parmesan, grated
flaked sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the salsa

5 ripe plum tomatoes, seeded and roughly chopped
1 small red onion, very finely chopped
2 tsp sun-dried tomato paste
1 tbsp chopped flat-leaf fresh parsley
1 tbsp fresh basil, roughly torn
1 tbsp lime juice
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
flaked sea salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Make the frittatas. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Whisk the eggs with the cream and plenty of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add the herbs, spring onions, parmesan, and then mix again.


Grease a bun tin with butter and pour in the mixture. Do not overfill the tray, as the egg mixture will soufflé slightly. Cook for 20-25 minutes when the frittatas should be firm.


Cool the frittatas on a cooling rack whilst cooking the remaining batches.


Make the salsa. Place all the ingredients into a mixing bowl, season well and mix thoroughly to combine.


Serve the frittatas with the chunky tomato salsa.
