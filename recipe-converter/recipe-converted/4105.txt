Ingredients
For the spaghetti

100g/3½oz plain flour
1 free-range egg
pinch salt

For the sauce

1 tbsp olive oil
½ onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
200g/7oz fresh chopped tomatoes
handful fresh basil, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


To make the spaghetti, mix the flour with the egg and salt in a blender until combined.


Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for one minute.


Wrap the dough in cling film and rest in the fridge for five minutes.


Roll the dough through a pasta machine according to the manufacturer's instructions until very thin.


Roll the dough through the spaghetti setting on the pasta machine and set the fresh spaghetti aside until you are ready to cook it.


To make the sauce, heat the oil in a frying pan. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened, but not browned.


Add the tomatoes and cook until broken down.


Cook the pasta in a large pan of salted boiling water for 30 seconds, before draining well.


Stir the basil through the tomato sauce and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Serve the pasta in a serving bowl with the sauce spooned over.
