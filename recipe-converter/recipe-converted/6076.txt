While this homemade mango chutney is delicious with curry, try it with cold meats to jazz up leftovers.



Ingredients

4 large mangoes, peeled, stoned and sliced
salt
4 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
450g/1lb caster sugar
2 baking apples, peeled, cored and chopped
1 tbsp English mustard powder
1 tbsp grated fresh root ginger
600ml/1 pint white wine vinegar
1 tbsp cayenne pepper




Method


Put the mango slices in a large bowl and sprinkle with salt. Leave overnight. In the morning, drain off the juice and rinse the fruit.


Put the garlic, sugar, apples, mustard, ginger, vinegar and cayenne pepper in a pan and, over a low heat, dissolve the sugar.


Bring to the boil and add the mangoes. Simmer for 30 minutes until the chutney is thick and syrupy. Spoon into sterilised jars and seal.
