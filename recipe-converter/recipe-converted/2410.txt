Adding chocolate to a classic banana bread recipe will make it a firm family favourite.



Ingredients

250g/9oz plain flour
25g/1oz cocoa powder
1 tsp baking powder
¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda
pinch salt
200g/7oz golden caster sugar
2 very ripe bananas, peeled, mashed
2 free-range eggs, beaten
125g/4½ butter, melted
100g/3½oz good-quality white chocolate, chopped
50g/2oz toasted chopped hazelnuts




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease and line a loaf tin.


Sift the plain flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, salt and sugar into a large bowl and mix until well combined.


Mash the bananas in a separate bowl, stir in the eggs and melted butter.


Fold the banana mixture into the flour mixture until just combined. Fold in the chocolate and nuts and spoon the mixture into the loaf tin.


Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the cake is risen and a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven, cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then remove the cake from the tin. Serve in slices.
