Ingredients
For the tortilla chips

vegetable oil, for deep-frying
2 flour tortillas, cut into triangles

For the bean dip

55g/2oz mixed beans from tin
2 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped
3-4 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the tomato dip

¼ tin tomatoes, chopped
2 tbsp tomato sauce
pinch chilli powder

To serve

Greek-style yoghurt
Handful fresh coriander, chopped




Method


Heat a pan one third filled with vegetable oil for deep-frying, until a crumb will sizzle gently in it. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be very dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Deep-fry the tortilla triangles for 30 seconds to one minute, or until golden, and then carefully remove and drain on kitchen paper.


For the bean dip, blend the beans, garlic, olive oil and seasoning in a food processor until smooth. Transfer to a dish.


For the tomato dip, blend the tinned tomato, tomato sauce and chilli powder in a food processor until smooth. Transfer to a dish.


Serve the tortilla chips alongside the dips and serve each with the yoghurt sprinkled with fresh coriander.
