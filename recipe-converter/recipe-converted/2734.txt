Neneh and Andi cook up a classic jerk chicken with a tangy twist.





By Neneh Cherry and Andi Oliver






Ingredients

8 shallots, finely chopped
8 garlic cloves, crushed or pounded
1 medium-sized knob ginger (about half a thumb)
1 handful fresh parsley, finely chopped
1 handful fresh coriander, finely chopped
2 limes, juice only
2 lemons, juice only
2 oranges, juice only
1 scotch bonnet chilli pepper, finely chopped
4 tbsp soy or tamari sauce
1 tsp ground nutmeg
1 handful fresh thyme, finely chopped
1 tbsp English mustard
1 tsp ground allspice
4-5 generous tbsp rum
1 tbsp freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp ground sea salt
2 tbsp olive oil
10 chicken pieces, thighs and legs only




Method


Place all the ingredients, except the chicken pieces, into a large bowl and mix well. Place the chicken pieces into the marinade and cover with cling film. Leave to marinate in the fridge for at least an hour, preferably overnight.


When you are ready to cook the chicken, prepare a barbecue grill, allowing the flames to die out before you begin cooking.


Remove the chicken pieces from the marinade and place straight onto the barbecue grill. Turn and baste them regularly with the marinade for about 40-50 minutes, or until completely cooked through and ready to serve.




Recipe Tips
This marinade can also be used for whole firm white fish. However, use 6 shallots, 6 garlic cloves and ½ knob ginger (about ¼ thumb). Marinate the fish for about 30 minutes and then place them in a barbecue fish cage and then on the grill. Turn the fish and baste with the marinade regularly for about 10-15 minutes.
