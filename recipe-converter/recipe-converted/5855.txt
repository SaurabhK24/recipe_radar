Ingredients

3 tsp olive oil
600g/1lb 5oz lamb leg steaks, all visible fat removed (500g/1lb 2oz after the fat is cut off), cut into bite-size pieces
2 onions, roughly chopped
2 garlic cloves, thickly sliced
250g/9oz celery (about 4 stalks), thickly sliced
400g/14oz carrots (about 4 medium carrots), peeled and thickly sliced
small handful fresh rosemary, finely chopped
few sprigs fresh thyme
1 tbsp plain flour
1 beef stock pot diluted to make 500ml/18fl oz stock
2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
2 tbsp tomato purée
650g/1lb 7oz floury potatoes, ideally Maris Piper, cut into thick slices
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 160C/140C Fan/Gas 3.


Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a large heavy-bottomed casserole over a medium to high heat. Brown the lamb on all sides in two batches for 3-4 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate using a slotted spoon.


Add another teaspoon of oil to the pan and add the onions, garlic, celery and carrots and fry, stirring, for 3-4 minutes. Add the rosemary and thyme and fry for another minute. Sprinkle over the flour and cook for 2 minutes, stirring all the time to cook the flour.


Return the lamb to the pan, pour in the stock and stir in the Worcestershire sauce and tomato purée, then bring to the boil.


Layer the potatoes on top in two overlapping layers, seasoning between the layers. Cover with the lid and bake in the oven for 1½ hours, or until the lamb and the potatoes are tender.


Remove the lid and increase the oven temperature to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Brush the potatoes with the final teaspoon of oil and bake for a further 15 minutes, or until the top is nicely browned.
