Ingredients
For the steak burger

150g/5½oz steak, trimmed of fat and roughly chopped
¼ onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
½ red or green chilli
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp plain flour
2 tbsp olive oil
baguette, split open
30g/1oz emmental cheese, grated, to serve

For the relish

1 tbsp olive oil
¼ Romero pepper, chopped
¼ red or green chilli, chopped
1 tbsp red wine vinegar
1 tsp caster sugar
1 tbsp honey
1 tsp lime juice




Method


For the burger, place the steak, onion, garlic and chilli in a food processor and pulse until minced. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and shape into a patty.


Dredge the burger in the flour. Heat one tablespoon of the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan and fry the burger for 3-4 minutes, or until cooked through.


Drizzle the cut sides of the baguette with the remaining oil and fry, oiled-side down, until lightly toasted, pressing down with a spatula if necessary.


For the relish, heat the oil in a small saucepan and fry the pepper and chilli together for 2-3 minutes, or until the pepper starts to soften.


Add the remaining ingredients and simmer for 4-5 minutes.


To serve, place the burger inside the baguette, sprinkle with cheese and top with a dollop of relish.
