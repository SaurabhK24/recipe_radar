Ingredients
For the pork

150g/5½oz pork loin, flattened with a meat mallet or rolling pin
1 tbsp olive oil
50g/1¾oz Dolcelatte cheese
1 long, wide leek leaf, blanched

For the butternut squash mash

50g/1¾oz Dolcelatte cheese
1 tbsp olive oil
100g/3½oz butternut squash, peeled, chopped and boiled until tender
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tsp fresh chives, chopped




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the pork, rub the pork with the olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper on both sides.


Spread the cheese along the length of the pork loin and then roll it up.


Wrap the rolled up pork loin in the leek leaf and place onto a baking sheet. Transfer to the oven, and roast for 15 minutes, or until the pork is completely cooked through.


For the butternut squash mash, place the cheese, oil and cooked butternut into a bowl. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then mash together.


To serve spoon the mash onto the middle of a serving plate, rest the pork on top and sprinkle over the chopped chives.
