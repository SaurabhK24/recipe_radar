Ingredients

180g/6oz organic pork loin, trimmed
1 lemon, zest only
1 small bunch fresh thyme, leaves only, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
3 small violet artichokes, quartered
3 small courgettes
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
1 punnet micro cress (you can substitute normal cress)




Method


Cut the pork loin into four equal-sized pieces. Lay the pieces between two pieces of cling film and bash with a meat mallet or rolling pin until very thin.


Lay the flattened pork pieces onto a plate and sprinkle with half of the lemon zest and half of the chopped thyme. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Heat two tablespoons of the olive oil in a frying pan over a low heat. Add the artichoke quarters and fry, turning occasionally.


Chop the courgettes to the same size as the artichoke pieces and add to the pan when the artichokes are just beginning to become golden-brown and tender.


Add the garlic and the remaining lemon zest, thyme leaves and a splash of water. Stir gently and add one more tablespoon of the olive oil. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Remove from the heat and set aside in a warm place.


Meanwhile, heat a griddle pan until smoking. Add the flattened pieces of pork loin (you may have to do these in batches). Cook for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown griddle marks are formed on both sides and the pork is cooked through.


To serve, place a piece of pork loin onto a serving plate and arrange some of the artichokes and courgettes on top. Place another pork piece over the top, then add another layer of vegetables. Repeat this layering until all of the pork pieces are used up. Snip some micro cress around the plate and finish with a drizzle of olive oil.
