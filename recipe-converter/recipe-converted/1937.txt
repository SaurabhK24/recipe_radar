Ingredients

15g/½oz butter
100g/3½oz spinach
2 free-range eggs
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp double cream
2 tbsp cheddar, grated




Method


Preheat oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the spinach. Cook for about one minute until the spinach has just wilted.


Lay the buttered spinach in the base of a small ovenproof dish.


Crack in the two eggs and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Add the cream and sprinkle evenly with the cheddar.


Bake in the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until the eggs have set and the top is golden-brown and bubbling.
