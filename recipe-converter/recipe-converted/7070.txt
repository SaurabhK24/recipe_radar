Ingredients
For the pan-fried cod

1 tbsp olive oil
1 x 150g/5½oz cod fillet, skin left on
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the tomato and cheese gratin

1 tomato, sliced
100g/3½oz mature cheddar, grated
75ml/2½fl oz white wine
2 rashers smoked streaky bacon, fried until crisp, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the pan-fried cod, heat the olive oil in an ovenproof frying pan. Season the cod with salt and freshly ground black pepper and fry, skin-side down, for 2-3 minutes, or until the skin is crisp.


Turn the cod over, then transfer the pan to the oven and roast for five minutes, or until cooked through.


For the tomato and cheese gratin, spread the tomato slices over the base of a small ovenproof dish.


Place the cheese and wine into a small pan and heat gently, stirring frequently, until melted and well combined. Pour the cheese mixture over the tomatoes.


Transfer the gratin to the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes, or until golden-brown.


To serve, place the gratin onto a serving plate and top with the cod and the bacon.
