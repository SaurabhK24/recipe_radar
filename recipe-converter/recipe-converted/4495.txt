Ingredients

600ml/20fl oz double cream
salt, to taste
brown bread, to serve
200g/7oz smoked salmon




Method


Pour the cream into a free-standing mixer and churn until the solid part has fully split. Remove and drain through a sieve and then wash under cold water, squeezing out any further liquids. Roll in greaseproof paper and place in the fridge.


To serve, once the butter has hardened in the fridge sprinkle it with a little salt and enjoy with sliced salmon and buttered brown bread.
