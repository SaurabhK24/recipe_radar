Feel free to multiply this recipe up for a buffet. Any leftover brandy snaps can be stored in an airtight container and filled with cream, or better, with ice cream.

Ingredients
For the brandy snap

60g/2¼oz butter, plus extra for greasing
2 tbsp caster sugar
2 heaped tbsp golden syrup
4 tbsp plain flour
1 tsp ground ginger
1 tsp brandy
2 tbsp chopped pistachios

For the fruit salad

1 orange, juice only
1 lime, juice only
1 lemon, juice only
1 mango, cut into cubes
4 clementines, separated into segments
1 pomegranate, seeds only
6 cape gooseberries (physalis)




Method


Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2. Grease two baking trays with butter.


For the brandy snaps, melt the butter with the sugar and golden syrup in a saucepan. As soon as it starts to bubble, add the flour, ginger, brandy and pistachios and stir until well combined.


Using a teaspoon, place six walnut-sized blobs of the mixture onto the buttered baking tray. No need to flatten, as they will spread naturally.


Bake for 10-12 minutes until golden-brown. Leave to cool on the baking tray for five minutes, and then lift them off with a palette knife. Lay them on a rolling pin to set.


For the fruit salad, combine the orange, lime and lemon juice in a large bowl.


Add the mango and the clementines, scatter over the pomegranate seeds and serve with the brandy snaps and a few physalis.
