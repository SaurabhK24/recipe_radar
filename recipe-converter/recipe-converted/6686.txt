Neck of lamb is a cheaper cut of meat, but no less delicious if cooked long and slow with plenty of seasoning.






By Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall






Ingredients

2 tbsp olive oil
1kg/2¼lb scrag end of neck of lamb, on the bone, or chops from the neck end, or both
juice of 1½ lemons, plus a little thinly pared rind
6-8 sprigs of thyme
a wine glass of water, or lamb stock
salt and fresh ground black pepper

To serve

white bread
Greek-style tomato and onion salad




Method


Heat the oil in a heavy-based saucepan. Add the lamb and allow it to sizzle and spit, turning occasionally until lightly browned all over.


Add the lemon juice, thyme, water or stock, a little salt and plenty of pepper. Bring to the boil then turn down the heat to a gentle simmer and place a lid on the pan. Cook gently, turning the meat over occasionally, for about 50 minutes, until the meat is tender.


Serve with plenty of good white bread and a perhaps a simple Greek style tomato and onion salad.
