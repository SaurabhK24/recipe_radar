Ingredients
For the mussels

1 tbsp olive oil
25g/1oz butter
½ onion, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, crushed
100ml/3½fl oz white wine
300g/10½oz mussels, cleaned, beards removed
1 large pinch saffron
3 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
100ml/3½fl oz double cream

To serve

crusty white bread
1 lemon, cut into wedges




Method


Heat the oil and butter in a pan and gently fry the onion and garlic for 2-3 minutes. Add the white wine and bring to a simmer. Add the mussels, cover with a tightly fitting lid and steam for 5-7 minutes, or until the mussels have opened up. Discard any mussels that have not opened. Add the saffron and parsley and mix well. Remove half of the mussels and juices to a serving bowl, and into the remaining half stir the cream, heating through until steaming.


Serve both bowls of mussels with crusty bread on the side and wedges of lemon.
