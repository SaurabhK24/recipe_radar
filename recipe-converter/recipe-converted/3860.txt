Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the tart, place the pastry rectangle onto a baking sheet.


Place the sliced figs onto the pastry, and sprinkle over the sugar, vanilla extract and hazelnuts.


Carefully place the pastry lattice on top of the figs then brush with the egg.


Transfer into the oven for 10 minutes until golden.


Remove from the oven, and cut the fig tart into slices.


For the spicy wine syrup, heat all the ingredients in a saucepan over a medium heat and gently cook to dissolve the sugar.


When the sugar has dissolved, turn up the heat to high and rapidly boil the liquid to reduce until thick and syrupy.


To serve, place the fig tart slices one on top of the other and drizzle over the syrup.
