Ingredients

150g/5½oz plain flour, seasoned with salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 courgette, cut into matchsticks
150ml/5fl oz milk
290ml/½ pint vegetable oil, for deep frying
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Place the flour into a large bowl. Add the courgette strips and toss to coat thoroughly.


Place the milk into a separate bowl and dip the courgette into the milk, then place into the flour again and toss to coat.


Heat the oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed pan. The oil is ready when a breadcrumb dropped into it will sizzle gently. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be very dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Carefully add the courgette strips and deep-fry until golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towels.


Serve in a warm bowl, sprinkled with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.
