Nigella Lawson’s vegetarian mincemeat recipe is packed with port, brandy, spices and dried fruit - what’s not to love?






By Nigella Lawson


From Nigella's Christmas Kitchen






Ingredients

75g/2½oz soft dark brown sugar
60ml/2fl oz ruby port
300g/10½oz cranberries
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground ginger
½ tsp ground cloves
75g/2½oz currants
75g/2½oz raisins
30g/1oz dried cranberries
1 clementine, zest and juice only
25ml/1fl oz brandy
few drops almond extract
½ tsp vanilla extract
2 tbsp honey




Method


In a large pan, dissolve the sugar in the ruby port over a gentle heat.


Add the cranberries and stir.


Add the cinnamon, ginger and cloves, currants, raisins, dried cranberries and the zest and juice of the clementine.


Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 20 minutes, or until the fruit has broken down and has absorbed most of the liquid in the pan. (You may need to squish the cranberries a little with the back of a wooden spoon to incorporate them fully.)


Remove from the heat and allow to cool a little.


Add the brandy, almond extract, vanilla extract and honey and stir well with a wooden spoon to mash the mixture down into a paste.


Spoon the mincemeat into sterilised jars and, once cool, store in the fridge for up to two weeks.
