By Tim Maddams






Ingredients
For the vegetable stock

1 carrot, grated
1 onion, grated
2 sticks celery, grated
2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
salt and pepper
stalks from a small bunch of parsley

For the leek soup

olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
200g/7oz floury potatoes, peeled and chopped into cubes
350g/12oz celeriac, peeled and chopped
1 sprig thyme, leaves only
4 leeks, finely sliced
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 small bunch chives, finely chopped




Method


To make the stock, put the grated carrot, onion, celery and garlic into a large heatproof bowl. Add a pinch of salt and pepper and pour over 1 litre/1¾ pints of boiling water. Set aside to steep for 10-15 minutes while you prepare the soup.


Heat a large heavy-based saucepan or casserole dish over a medium heat. Add a dash of oil and, once hot, add the onion, potatoes, celeriac and thyme leaves. Cook over a medium heat for 10 minutes, or until the vegetables have softened.


Strain the stock through a sieve into the pan of celeriac. Simmer gently for 10-15 minutes until the celeriac is nearly tender.


Add the leeks, cover the pan and cook for a further 5-7 minutes, or until the leeks are wilted and tender but still bright green.


Remove from the heat and blend in batches until really smooth. (Blend for a minute or longer for a really velvety texture.) The soup can be stored in the fridge or frozen at this stage.


Transfer the blended soup to a clean pan. Reheat the soup if necessary, taste and season with salt and pepper to taste.To serve, spoon into bowls and garnish with chopped chives.
