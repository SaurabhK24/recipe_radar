What could be better than crisp squid and watermelon on a hot summer's day? Serve it with a glass of something cold when you have friends round.

Ingredients

¼ small watermelon, skin removed and reserved
100ml/3½fl oz sherry vinegar
100g/3½oz clear honey
50g/1¾oz vine leaves in brine, dried out in a low oven
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to garnish
500g/1lb 2oz squid, cleaned, scored and cut into bite-sized pieces, tentacles reserved
200g/7oz green olives
200g/7oz goats’ curd, broken into small pieces
salt flakes and cracked black pepper
flat leaf parsley, to garnish




Method


Cut the watermelon flesh into rectangles about 15x5cm/6x2in. Store in the fridge until needed. Cut out circles from the skin using a 2-3cm cutter.


Place the sherry vinegar and honey in a small saucepan and heat for 2-3 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the cut skin of the watermelon. Set aside.


Meanwhile, heat a griddle pan until hot. Drizzle the olive oil over the squid and season with salt and pepper. Grill the squid and tentacles until lightly charred and the flesh is no longer transparent.


Arrange the watermelon, olives and goat’s curd on serving plates. Put the calamari and crisp vine leaves on top and finish with parsley leaves, a drizzle of olive oil and a final grinding of salt and pepper. Finish with the circles of melon rind.
