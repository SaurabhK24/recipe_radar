A quick family dinner that everyone will love, this macaroni cheese can also be made with vegetarian cheese.





By Gail Richards






Ingredients

250g/9oz macaroni
40g/1½oz butter
40g/1½ plain flour
600ml/1pint 1½fl oz milk
250g/9oz grated cheddar
50g/2oz grated parmesan (or a similar vegetarian alternative)




Method


Cook the macaroni in a large saucepan of boiling salted water for 8-10 minutes; drain well and set aside.


Melt the butter over a medium heat in a saucepan slightly larger than that used for the macaroni. Add the flour and stir to form a roux, cooking for a few minutes.


Gradually whisk in the milk, a little at a time. Cook for 10-15 minutes to a thickened and smooth sauce.


Meanwhile, preheat the grill to hot.


Remove the sauce from the hob, add 175g/6oz of the cheese and stir until the cheese is well combined and melted.


Add the macaroni to the sauce and mix well. Transfer to a deep suitably-sized ovenproof dish.


Sprinkle over the remaining cheddar and the parmesan and place the dish under the hot grill. Cook until the cheese is browned and bubbling. Serve straightaway.
