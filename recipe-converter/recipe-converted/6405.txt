Ingredients

4 free-range eggs, separated
75g/2½ oz cheddar cheese, grated
3 tbsp double cream
handful rocket, chopped
½ tsp cornflour
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp chopped chives, plus extra to garnish
2 tsp butter




Method


Preheat the oven, and a baking sheet to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Place the egg yolks, cheese, cream, rocket and cornflour into a bowl and mix together.


Place the egg whites into a clean bowl and whisk, until the egg whites form stiff, glossy peaks when the whisk is removed.


Fold the egg white mixture into the egg yolk mixture and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Fold one tablespoon of the chopped chives into the egg mixture.


Melt a teaspoon of butter in two small omelette pans over a medium heat. Divide the mixture between the two pans.


Place the pans onto the preheated baking sheet and place into the oven to cook for six minutes, until risen and golden.


Serve immediately, garnished with the rest of the chopped chives.
