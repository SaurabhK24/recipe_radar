Ingredients
For the vanilla cream

150ml/5½fl oz double cream
100ml/3½fl oz Greek-style yoghurt
1 vanilla pod, seeds only
2 tbsp icing sugar

For the glazed oranges

2 oranges, peeled and sliced
2 tbsp icing sugar

To serve

2 sprigs fresh mint
icing sugar, to dust




Method


For the vanilla cream, using an electric hand whisk, whisk the cream until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed.


Whisk in the yoghurt, vanilla seeds and icing sugar and set aside.


For the oranges, spread the orange slices onto a baking tray and dredge with the icing sugar. Using a mini-blowtorch, caramelise the sugar until golden-brown and bubbling.


To serve, place a slice of orange into the base of two glasses. Spoon in the vanilla cream and top with the remaining oranges. Garnish with sprigs of mint and a dusting of icing sugar.
