Ingredients

75g/2Â½oz fresh chives
4 thin, square slices dark rye or pumpernickel bread
50g/2oz light cream cheese
200g/7oz smoked or cured salmon, finely sliced
50g/2oz salmon roe
1 lemon, quartered




Method


With a pair of scissors, very finely snip the chives, and arrange on a flat plate.


Spread the bread with the cream cheese right to the edges.


Lay the bread cheese-side down on the chives, pressing lightly, until each slice is completely covered with a fine layer of chives, from edge to edge.


Cut each slice into four squares. Trim the salmon and fold on top of each bread.


Top with a little salmon roe and a few snipped chives and serve with the lemon wedges.
