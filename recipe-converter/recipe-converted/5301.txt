Ingredients

100ml/3½fl oz buttermilk
1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing
1 free-range egg, beaten
50g/2oz plain flour
50g/2oz quick-cook dried polenta
1 tsp baking powder
pinch freshly ground black pepper
50g/2oz soft goats’ cheese
small handful basil leaves, torn, plus extra to serve
1 tbsp grated parmesan, or similar Italian hard cheese
small pinch dried chilli flakes
2 slices mozzarella, to serve
1 tomato, sliced, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/450F/Gas 7. Grease a small loaf tin with olive oil.


Mix the buttermilk, olive oil and beaten egg together in a large bowl until well combined.


In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, polenta, baking powder and freshly ground black pepper.


Stir the goats’ cheese, basil, parmesan and chilli flakes into the flour mixture until well combined.


Add the buttermilk mixture to the cheese mixture and beat together well, beating as quickly as you can.


Spoon the cornbread mixture into the prepared loaf tin and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until golden-brown and cooked through (a skewer inserted into the centre of the cornbread should come out clean).


Serve the cornbread in slices with a mozzarella, tomato and basil salad.
