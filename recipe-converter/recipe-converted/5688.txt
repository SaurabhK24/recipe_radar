This is such a simple cake - a variation on the classic lemon drizzle - and it works a treat. It has a wonderful, light texture, a very fresh taste and it looks incredibly pretty – perfect with a cuppa on a sunny afternoon.
  You can buy dried, edible lavender from baking suppliers and some supermarkets. Alternatively, if you have lavender growing in your garden, you can use fresh buds and leaves, finely chopped.

Ingredients
For the cake

250g/9oz plain flour
½ tsp baking powder
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
125g/4½oz caster sugar
1½ tbsp edible lavender
2 unwaxed lemons, finely grated zest only
2 large free-range eggs
200g/7oz plain, full-fat yoghurt
100g/3½oz unsalted butter, melted

For the lemon drizzle

juice of 2 lemons, strained
2 tbsp icing sugar

For the topping

1 tbsp granulated sugar
2 tsp edible lavender




Method


Heat your oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Line a 1kg/2lb 4oz loaf tin (around 10x20cm/4x8in base measurement) with baking parchment.


In a bowl, combine the flour, raising agents, sugar, lavender and lemon zest.


In a jug, beat the eggs with the yoghurt and melted butter. Pour this onto the dry ingredients and, using a spatula, stir until just combined.


Pour into the prepared tin and bake for 40 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.


Remove the cake from the oven and prick it deeply all over with a cocktail stick.


Mix the ingredients for the drizzle together and pour over the hot cake. Sprinkle over the granulated sugar and then the lavender. Leave to cool completely in the tin before slicing.
