Ingredients
For the butternut squash

200g/7oz butternut squash, seeds removed and thinly sliced
2 tbsp olive oil
1 clove garlic, sliced
2 tbsp chopped fresh rosemary
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the halloumi

1 tbsp olive oil
100g/3½oz halloumi, sliced into three pieces




Method


For the butternut squash, place the butternut squash, olive oil, garlic and fresh rosemary into a large bowl, season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix together.


Heat a frying pan over a low heat. Add the butternut squash mixture and fry gently until cooked through.


For the halloumi, heat the oil in a separate small frying pan over a medium heat. Add the halloumi and fry for two minutes on each side, until golden-brown.


Serve the butternut squash on a warm plate with the fried halloumi on top.
