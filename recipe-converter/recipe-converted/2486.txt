Ingredients
For the mousse cake

2 free-range eggs, beaten
55g/2oz plain flour
15g/½oz caster sugar
30g/1oz cocoa powder, plus extra for dusting
¼ red chilli, seeds removed, chopped
butter, for greasing
¼ mango, peeled, sliced

For the sesame brittle

100g/3½oz caster sugar
1 tbsp sesame seeds

For the caramelised chilli mango

½ mango, sliced
½ red chilli, seeds removed, chopped
icing sugar, to dust
double cream, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the mousse cake, place the eggs, flour, sugar, cocoa powder and chilli into a food processor and blend to combine.


Lightly grease a 6cm/2½in chefs' ring and place onto a non-stick baking sheet. Place the sliced mango into the base of the ring, top with the chocolate mousse mixture and smooth the top using the back of a spoon.


Transfer to the oven and bake for 12-15 minutes.


Remove the cake from the oven and place the ring onto a serving plate. Warm the outside of the ring with a mini-blowtorch to loosen it, then remove it and dust the cake with cocoa powder.


For the sesame brittle, gently melt the sugar in a frying pan until golden-brown and completely melted.


Pour the hot caramel onto a non-stick baking sheet, sprinkle over the sesame seeds and leave to cool for a few minutes. Cut out a small disc of sesame brittle using a metal pastry cutter.


For the caramelised chilli mango, place the sliced mango onto a baking sheet, sprinkle with the chopped chilli and dust heavily with icing sugar. Using a mini-blowtorch, caramelise the mango all over.


To serve, place the caramelised chilli mango onto a serving plate with the chocolate and mango mousse cake. Serve with the sesame brittle and pour over some double cream.
