Method


For the lamb, place the oil, lamb, rosemary and thyme into a bowl and mix well. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Heat a griddle pan until smoking then add the lamb. Cook for three minutes on each side, or until cooked through, then remove from the heat and leave to rest for two minutes.


For the beans and beetroot, melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the beetroot and cook for three minutes.

To serve, place the beans in the middle of a plate and place the lamb on top.
