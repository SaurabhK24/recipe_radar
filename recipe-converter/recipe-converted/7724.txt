A straightforward easy guide to getting perfect rice every time.






By Anton Edelmann


From Saturday Kitchen






Ingredients

225g/8oz long grain rice
350ml/12fl oz water




Method


Put the rice in a saucepan. Wash rice with cold water. Drain and repeat the process twice.


Add clean water to the rice.


Cook rice over high heat, bring to the boil, uncovered.


Switch to very low heat and cover with a lid. Simmer the rice for 15-20 minutes. Do not take lid off until time is up. (This is the crucial as the rice is steam-cooked under pressure.)


When done, fluff up the rice with a fork or chop sticks and serve hot.
