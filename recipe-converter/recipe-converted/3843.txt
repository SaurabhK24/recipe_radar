Ingredients

450g/1lb plain flour, plus extra for dusting
1 tsp fine salt
1 x 7g sachet fast-action yeast
180ml/6fl oz warm milk
4 tbsp warm water
1 tsp honey
4 tbsp natural yoghurt
2 tbsp sunflower oil, plus extra for greasing
225g/8oz dried figs, roughly chopped
1 tbsp cracked black pepper




Method


Mix the flour and salt in a bowl. Add the fast action yeast and stir well.


In a jug, mix together the milk, water and honey.


Pour the contents of the jug into the dry ingredients. Add the yoghurt and oil and bring together with your hands to form a soft dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for about five minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic.


Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover and leave to prove in a warm place for 1½ hours. After proving, knead the dough again to knock it back.


Push the dried figs and black pepper into the dough and knead firmly to incorporate into the dough.


Divide the dough into eight equal portions and roll out on a floured surface to approximately 1cm/½in thick.


Lightly dust two baking trays with flour and arrange the flatbreads next to each other on the trays, leaving plenty of room between each one. Cover with a clean cloth and leave to prove for a further 15-20 minutes.


Preheat the grill to a medium setting and grill the flatbreads for about 2-3 minutes each side, or until lightly browned. Do not move away from the grill while they are cooking or you could end up with singed flat breads!
