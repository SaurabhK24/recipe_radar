Ingredients

2 carrots, peeled and roughly chopped
2 onions, peeled and quartered
2 stalks celery, roughly chopped
½ bulb fennel, roughly chopped
stalk from a head of broccoli, roughly chopped
2 tomatoes
8 button mushrooms, halved
6 black peppercorns
1 dried bay leaf
3 fresh parsley stalks




Method


Put all the ingredients into a large pan and cover with water. Bring to the boil. Cover and simmer very gently for 20-30 minutes. Strain into a large bowl and allow to cool.


Use within 3 days or freeze. To freeze, reduce the stock by half by boiling vigorously and cool. Pour into ice-cube trays and freeze. When frozen put the cubes into a bag, label it, and when you want to use one, just put in a jug and add boiling water to dissolve the cube.
