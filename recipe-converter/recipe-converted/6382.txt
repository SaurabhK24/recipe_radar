Ingredients
For the cakes

150g/5½oz butter, softened
150g/5½oz light muscovado sugar
3 large free-range eggs
150g/5½oz self-raising flour
1 level tsp baking powder
1 tbsp coffee essence
75g/2½oz chopped walnuts

For the filling and decoration

150g/5½oz butter, softened
450g/1lb icing sugar, sifted
2 tbsp milk
1 tbsp coffee essence
200g/7oz walnut halves, finely chopped
16 chocolate-covered coffee beans




Method


Preheat the oven to 190C/170C(fan)/375F/Gas 5. Grease a 16-cup mini cake tin and line with baking parchment, or, alternatively, grease 16 chefs’ rings (5cm/2in diameter) and place them on a baking tray lined with baking parchment.


For the cakes, place the butter, sugar, eggs, flour, baking powder and coffee essence into a bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until thoroughly blended and smooth. Fold in the walnuts.


Divide or pipe the mixture equally between the mini cake tins. Bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until well-risen and the top of the cake springs back when lightly pressed with a finger.


Leave to cool in the tins for a few minutes. When cool enough to handle, turn the cakes out of the tins and remove the parchment. Leave to cool completely on a wire rack.


For the filling and decoration, beat together the butter, icing sugar, milk and coffee essence in a bowl until smooth.


When the cakes are completely cold, trim the tops if domed. Slice in half horizontally, then sandwich them together with about a quarter of the buttercream.


Spread a thin coating of buttercream around the sides of each cake and then roll the sides in chopped walnuts.


Spoon the remaining buttercream into a piping bag fitted with a small star (2D) nozzle and pipe a rose on the top of each cake. Place a chocolate-covered coffee bean over the joins.


Arrange the cupcakes on the nicest cake stand you have and serve.
