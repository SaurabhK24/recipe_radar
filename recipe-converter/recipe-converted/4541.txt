Ingredients
For the chorizo rice

100g/3Â½oz chorizo
1 onion, sliced
1 garlic clove, sliced
200g/7oz short-grain rice such as arborio rice
4 tomatoes, roughly chopped
50g/2oz butter
1 tbsp parsley
600ml/20fl oz chicken stock
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the salmon

4 x 150g/5oz salmon fillets, skinned
250g/9oz smoked salmon
1 lemon, juice only




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Heat a heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat and fry the chorizo for 3-4 minutes, or until crisp. Remove the chorizo from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside.


Fry the onion and garlic in the remaining oil for 3-4 minutes, or until soft.


Place the chorizo, onion, garlic, rice, tomatoes, butter and parsley into a well-buttered casserole dish. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Pour over the chicken stock, cover with a tight-fitting lid and bake in the oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until the rice is cooked.


Meanwhile, wrap each salmon fillet in smoked salmon and trim off any excess flesh. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and squeeze over with the lemon juice.


Roast the salmon pieces in the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until cooked through.


Serve the salmon on top of the chorizo rice.




Recipe Tips
To make this recipe even easier, just use plain salmon fillets without the smoked salmon.
