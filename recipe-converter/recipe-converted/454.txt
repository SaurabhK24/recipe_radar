Ingredients

vegetable oil, for deep-frying
100g/3½oz organic tofu, cubed
1 tbsp olive oil
pinch chilli flakes
½ red pepper, de-seeded and sliced
100g/3½oz spinach leaves
4 mushrooms, sliced




Method


Heat a deep, heavy-bottomed pan, one-third filled with vegetable oil, until a breadcrumb will sizzle gently in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous! Do not leave unattended.)


Carefully add the tofu cubes to the oil and fry for 2-3 minutes or until golden and crisp. Remove using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towels.


Heat the olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan. Add the chilli flakes and fry for 1-2 minutes.


Add the red pepper and sauté for 2-3 minutes to soften.


Add the spinach leaves and mushrooms and cook gently until the spinach has wilted.


Stir in the deep-fried tofu and cook until heated through.


Transfer the tofu stir-fry to a warm bowl and serve at once.
