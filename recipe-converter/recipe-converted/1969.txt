A wonderfully easy and comforting pudding. You could substitute the cherries for other soft fruit.

Ingredients
For the clafoutis

2 free-range eggs
75g/2¾oz caster sugar, plus extra for dusting
40g/1½oz plain flour
100ml/3½fl oz double cream or crème fraîche
100ml/3½fl oz milk
butter, for greasing
225g/8oz cherries, stoned

For the cream

150ml/5fl oz double cream
25g/1oz icing or caster sugar
seeds from 1 vanilla pod




Method


For the clafoutis, preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Place the eggs and sugar in a large bowl and whisk together. Sift over the flour and whisk well then stir in cream or crème fraîche and milk. Leave to rest for 10 minutes.


Lightly butter a large baking dish and sprinkle with sugar to coat. Scatter the cherries in the dish and gently pour over the clafoutis batter. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the batter is just firm to the touch. If it is too soft in the centre, bake for a further five minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool a little before serving.


Whip together the cream, sugar and vanilla seeds to soft peaks and spoon over the clafoutis.
