Ingredients
For the lemon meringue pie

175g/6oz mascarpone
2 tbsp icing sugar
1 tbsp ready-made lemon curd
2 ready-made shortbread biscuits, crushed
2 tsp runny honey
2 free-range egg whites
2 tbsp caster sugar

For the raspberry coulis

100g/3½oz raspberries
30g/1oz icing sugar
2 tbsp hot water




Method


To make the lemon meringue pie, mix together the mascarpone, icing sugar and lemon curd. Mix the crushed shortbread biscuits with the honey and press into a 5cm/2in chefs' ring. Spoon the lemon curd mixture onto the biscuit and refrigerate.


Whisk together the egg whites and caster sugar until stiff peaks form and the mixture is glossy. Remove the lemon and biscuit mixture from the fridge and using a mini blow torch, heat the outside of the chefs' ring quickly to release the pie. Slide onto a plate. Spoon the meringue onto the pie and, using a mini blow torch, brown the meringue.


To make the coulis, put the raspberries, icing sugar and hot water into a mini blender and blitz until smooth.


To serve, pour the raspberry coulis round the lemon meringue pie.
