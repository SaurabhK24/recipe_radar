Ingredients
For the butternut squash base

1 butternut squash, peeled
olive oil, for drizzling
6 garlic cloves
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the topping

2 tbsp olive oil
2 onions, sliced
450g/1lb assorted mushrooms
½ lemon, juice only
125ml/4½fl oz double cream
1 tbsp chopped fresh tarragon
1 tbsp fresh or frozen peas
watercress, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Cut the top section of a butternut squash into four thick slices. Trim the sides of each piece into a square shape.


Place the butternut squash pieces in a roasting tin and drizzle with olive oil. Add the garlic cloves and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place in the oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until the butternut squash is soft but not falling apart.


Meanwhile for the topping, heat the oil in a frying pan, add the onions and cook over a low heat for 20 minutes, or until softened and caramelised.


Add the mushrooms and cook for five minutes.


Add the lemon juice and cook for 2-3 minutes further, or until evaporated. Add the peas, cream and tarragon and cook for a further 5-6 minutes, or until the sauce thickens slightly.


Place a piece of butternut squash on each plate, spoon over the mushrooms and serve with baby watercress.
