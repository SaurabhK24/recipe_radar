Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
½ leek, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
sprig fresh thyme, leaves only
½ vegetable stock cube, crumbled
150ml/¼ pint milk
1 small potato, peeled and chopped
1 tbsp double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives, to serve




Method


Heat the olive oil in a small pan, add the leek and sauté for 3-4 minutes, until softened. Add the garlic and thyme and fry for a further minute.


Add the half stock cube, the milk and potato. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 6-8 minutes, or until the potato is tender.


Stir in the cream, season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and allow to cool slightly.


Pour the soup into a food processor and blend until smooth. If necessary, gently reheat the soup before serving.


To serve, pour the soup into a bowl or cappuccino cup and sprinkle with chives.
