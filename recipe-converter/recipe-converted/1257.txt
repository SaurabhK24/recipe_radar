Everyone loves a big pillowy Yorkshire pud and I can guarantee you success if you follow this recipe, which I have been making to serve with Sunday lunches for many years.

  Equipment and preparation: you will need a 12-hole deep bun tin, or two four-hole Yorkshire pudding tins or a large roasting tin.

Ingredients

100g/3½oz plain flour
¼ tsp salt
3 large free-range eggs
225ml/8fl oz milk
sunflower oil




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7 (200C fan).


Measure the flour and salt into a bowl and make a well in the centre. Add the eggs and a little milk. Whisk until smooth and gradually add the remaining milk. This can be done with a wooden spoon, but is easier with an electric hand-held whisk. Pour the mixture into a jug.


Measure a dessertspoonful of oil into each hole of the 12 bun tray, or a tablespoonful in each hole of the four hole tins, or three tablespoonfuls into the roasting tin. Transfer to the preheated oven for five minutes, or until the oil is piping hot.


Carefully remove from the oven and pour the batter equally between the holes or the tin.


Return the batter quickly to the oven and cook for 20-25 minutes (35 if making the Yorkshire pudding in the roasting tin), or until golden-brown and well-risen. Serve immediately.




Recipe Tips
The puddings can be made completely ahead and reheated in a hot oven for about eight minutes. The batter can be made up to two hours ahead. The cooked puddings can be frozen and cooked from frozen in a preheated oven for about 10 minutes. It is very important to get the oil piping hot. As soon as the batter is poured in it will set and start to cook giving you crisp well-risen puds.
