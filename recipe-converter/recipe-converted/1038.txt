Ingredients

2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
2 slices white country bread, torn
salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
85g/3oz feta cheese, crumbled
100g/3½oz broccoli, cut into florets
70g/2½oz cherry tomatoes
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Heat the olive oil in a frying pan. Add the torn bread and fry for five minutes, or until golden. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste, and place in a large bowl with the feta cheese.


Boil the broccoli florets in salted boiling water for four minutes, or until just cooked. Drain and add to the mixture in the large bowl.


For the tomatoes, place the cherry tomatoes on a baking tray with a dash of olive oil. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and roast in the oven for ten minutes.


Add the tomatoes to the bowl with one tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and a splash of olive oil. Toss well and then spoon onto a serving plate.
