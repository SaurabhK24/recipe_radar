Ingredients

2 chicken breasts, skin removed
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tsp olive oil
½ chicken stock cube dissolved in 125ml/4½fl oz hot water, to make stock
30g/1oz butter
½ lemon, juice only
2 large tortilla wraps or Turkish flatbreads

For the dressing

150ml/5½fl oz Greek-style yoghurt
1 tbsp chopped fresh mint, plus extra to garnish

To serve

1 Little Gem lettuce, shredded
1 large carrot, grated
1 tomato, sliced
chilli or tahini sauce, to taste




Method


Slice each chicken breast into 5-6 long strips and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and fry the chicken breasts over a medium heat for 3-5 minutes, turning occasionally, until lightly browned.


Pour the stock over the chicken. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 3-5 minutes. Add the butter and lemon juice and stir. Simmer for 5-7 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. (No pink should remain when the meat is cut into. If any pink remains, cook further.) Keep warm.


Warm the tortilla wraps in the frying pan for 1-2 minutes on each side. Remove and keep warm.


For the dressing, mix the yoghurt and chopped mint into a clean bowl and mix well.


To serve, divide the chicken pieces between the flatbreads. Stuff with fresh grated carrot, mixed salad leaves, sliced tomato and any sauces. Dollop on the yoghurt dressing.
