Whether you take it on a picnic or in your lunchbox, this is a perfect quick pasta salad.



Ingredients

300g/10½oz pasta shapes such as penne or macaroni
250g/9oz cherry tomatoes, halved
sea salt
100g/3½oz black olives, stoned, halved
200g/7oz feta cheese, crumbled
225g/7oz baby spinach
3 tbsp lemon-infused olive oil
2 tbsp pine nuts, toasted
large handful torn basil




Method


Cook the pasta in a large pan of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain the pasta, rinse in cold water and tip into a large bowl.


Add the halved tomatoes to the pasta and sprinkle with sea salt. Add the olives, feta and spinach and drizzle with the lemon olive oil. Add the pine nuts and basil and toss gently before serving.




Recipe Tips
Use whatever pasta shapes you like such as penne or macaroni or add a handful of cooked chicken or ham. Pack the spinach separately if you’re not eating this salad straight away and mix it in before serving.
