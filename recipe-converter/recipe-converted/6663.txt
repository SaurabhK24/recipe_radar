Ingredients

125g/4oz plain flour
big pinch of salt
2 eggs
200ml/7fl oz milk
90ml/3fl oz water
60g/2oz butter
strawberries
blueberries
raspberries
maple syrup




Method


Sift the flour and salt into a mixing bowl. Then make a well in the centre of the flour.


Break the eggs into the well. Whisk the eggs and flour together. Next mix together the water and milk in a separate bowl or jug.


Add the liquid to the flour, a little at a time, whisking to make a smooth batter. Melt two tablespoons of the butter in a saucepan or microwave and stir it into the batter. Sieve if lumpy.


Melt remaining butter in a small frying pan - just use enough to coat the bottom of the pan.


Add the batter - you'll need about two tablespoons for each pancake. Tilt the pan so the batter covers the base.


Cook the pancake for about one minute. Use a spatula to loosen it, then flip it over! Cook the second side for 30 seconds. Repeat with the remaining batter until batter is used up. Keep pancakes warm in the meantime.


Fill the pancakes with fresh fruit and plenty of maple syrup.
