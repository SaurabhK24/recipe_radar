Get the kids baking with these simple biscuits. Let their imagination run wild with the icing!



Ingredients

100g/3½oz unsalted butter, softened at room temperature
100g/3½oz caster sugar
1 medium free-range egg, lightly beaten
275g/10oz plain flour
1 tsp vanilla extract

To decorate

400g/14oz icing sugar
3-4 tbsp water
2-3 drops food colourings




Method


Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5. Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper.


Cream the butter and sugar together in a bowl until combined.


Beat in the egg and vanilla extract, a little at a time, until well combined.


Stir in the flour until the mixture comes together as a dough.


Roll the dough out on a lightly floured work surface to a thickness of 1cm/½in.


Using biscuit cutters, cut biscuits out of the dough and carefully place onto the baking tray.


Bake the biscuits for 8-10 minutes, or until pale golden-brown. Set aside to harden for 5 minutes, then cool on a wire rack.


For the icing, sift the icing sugar into a large mixing bowl and stir in enough water to create a smooth mixture. Stir in the food colouring.


Carefully spread the icing onto the biscuits using a knife and set aside until the icing hardens.
