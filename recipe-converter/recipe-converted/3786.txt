Ingredients

100g/3½oz fillet steak, cut into strips
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil

For the guacamole

1 ripe avocado, skinned and chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed to a paste
1 tbsp olive oil
½ lime, zest and juice
½ beef tomato, chopped
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander

To serve

2 tortilla wraps

Method


Season the steak strips with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat the olive oil in a pan, then fry the steak for 1-2 minutes on both sides (for medium), or until cooked to your liking. Remove from the pan and allow to rest on a warm plate.


For the guacamole, mash the avocado and garlic together with a fork, and then mix in the remaining guacamole ingredients.


To serve, wrap the steak, guacamole and yoghurt up in two tortilla wrap.
