Ingredients

20 raw king prawns, heads removed and shelled - butterfly them to
remove waste
wooden skewers (soaked to stop them burning when barbequed or griddled)

For the marinade

1 red chilli
1 thumb-sized piece of ginger , peeled
1 garlic clove
a little lime juice
1 tsp vegetable oil

For the salad

½ fresh pineapple, cut into 1cm/½in dice
110g/4oz mooli (daikon radish), cut into fine batons (julienne) 7.5cm/3in long
200g/7oz mangetout, cut on an angle finely
2 carrots, cut into fine batons (julienne) 7.5cm/3in long
1 red onion, finely sliced
1 heaped tbsp coriander, coarsely chopped
2 red chillies, finely diced
½ thumb-sized piece of ginger, finely diced

For the salad dressing

110ml/4fl oz rice wine vinegar
2 limes, zest and juice
2 tbsp caster sugar




Method


In a pestle and mortar pound the marinade ingredients (the chilli, ginger, garlic, lime juice and oil) and add the prawns, allowing them to marinate for 1 hour.


Once the prawns have marinated, skewer them on to the wooden skewers - about four per skewer depending on the size of the prawns.


On a hot griddle pan place the prawn skewers and cook for a couple of minutes on each side (the prawns will turn pink).


Meanwhile prepare the salad ingredients and mix the dressing in well - almost bruising the vegetables.


Serve the salad in the middle of a plate and place two skewers on top and eat immediately.
