Cooking for yourself does not have to be a chore, this pepper-crusted juicy steak is cooked in ten minutes.






By Gino D'Acampo






Ingredients

200g/7oz sirloin steak
1 small free-range egg, lightly beaten
2 tsp coarsely ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil
green salad, to serve




Method


Dip the steak in the beaten egg and sprinkle with the pepper to coat.


Heat the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan and fry the steak for four minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking.


Leave the steak to rest for 5 minutes before serving with the salad.
