Ingredients

2 tbsp caster sugar
2 tbsp water
1 pear, halved and cored, one half left whole, the other half chopped
4 lemon verbena leaves, chopped, plus extra for garnish
1 orange, zest and juice only
85g/3oz cream cheese
1 tbsp icing sugar
½ vanilla pod, seeds only




Method


Place the caster sugar in a pan with the water, and gently heat without stirring until the sugar dissolves and is beginning to caramelise. Add the chopped pear, chopped verbena leaves and a squeeze of the orange juice and stir.


Place the pear half, cut-side down, in the pan and leave to simmer for 5-6 minutes.


In a bowl, mix together the cream cheese, remaining orange juice and zest, the icing sugar and vanilla seeds.


Place a chefs' ring onto a serving plate and spoon in half of the chopped pear. Pack the cream cheese mixture on top and then carefully remove the ring. Place the pear half on top, spoon the remaining chopped pear and pan juices around the plate and garnish with a few lemon verbena leaves.
