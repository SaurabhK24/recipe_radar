Ingredients

2 chicken breasts
1 stock cube
1 red onion
3 cloves garlic
olive oil
200g/7oz ripe cherry tomatoes (ideally a mix of red and yellow)
small bunch of basil
1 tbsp chopped thyme
1 tbsp chopped sage
2 lemons




Method


Poach the chicken breasts in boiling water with a stock cube and half a lemon for ten minutes. Leave in the hot stock until ready to serve.


Meanwhile soften the red onion and two chopped cloves of garlic together in a little olive oil.


Add the tomatoes and cook for six or seven minutes.


When the tomatoes are warmed through, add another glug of olive oil, seasoning, and a small handful of shredded basil.


Make the marinade. Place the thyme, sage, the last clove of garlic and a few basil leaves into a blender with the juice of a lemon and equal amounts of olive oil. Pulse for a few seconds.


Just before serving, slice the hot chicken into five or six pieces, without cutting all the way through. Drain the poaching liquor and place the semi-sliced chicken back into the dry pan.


Pour the lemon and herb marinade over the chicken and make sure it coats the chicken evenly. Heat through.


To serve, spoon the tomato sauce on the bottom of a dish, finish slicing the chicken and place on top. Drizzle over the remaining marinade and sprinkle on some chopped basil.
