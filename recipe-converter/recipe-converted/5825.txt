A bit of a cheat this syllabub, using ready-made lemon curd... but so delicious, you don't need to tell anyone.

From Saturday Kitchen






Ingredients

4 lemon shortbread biscuits
110ml/4fl oz sweet vermouth
250ml/9fl oz double cream
4 tbsp icing sugar
8 tbsp lemon curd
2 tbsp flaked almonds, toasted
2 sprigs fresh mint




Method


Crumble a biscuit into the bottom of each of four sundae glasses.


Drizzle over one tablespoon of sweet vermouth into each glass.


Pour the cream into a bowl and add the icing sugar.


Whisk the cream until soft peaks form.


Fold in the remaining sweet vermouth.


Add the lemon curd and lightly fold through, leaving a marbled effect.


Spoon the cream mixture into each of the glasses.


Top with the flaked almonds and a sprig of mint.


Serve chilled.
