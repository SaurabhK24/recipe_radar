Ingredients

300ml/10½fl oz vegetable oil for deep-frying
150g/5½oz stuffing
50g/1¾oz cooked turkey, chopped
2 handfuls fresh parsley, chopped
1 tbsp soy sauce




Method


Heat a heavy bottomed saucepan, a third full of vegetable oil, until a breadcrumb sizzles in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous! Do not leave unattended.)


In a bowl mix the stuffing with the cooked turkey and roll out into six small balls.


Add the stuffing balls to the hot vegetable oil and cook for four minutes, until golden. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towels.


To serve, place the chopped parsley on a plate, top with the stuffing balls and sprinkle over the soy sauce.
