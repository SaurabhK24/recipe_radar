Ingredients
For the Thai-style vegetable broth

2 garlic cloves
150ml/¼ pint double cream
large handful fresh coriander
pinch chilli flakes
½ carrot, cut into batons
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 pak choi, quartered

For the crisp fried noodles

300ml/10fl oz vegetable oil, for deep frying
125g/4½oz egg noodles, blanched and drained well
fresh coriander, to garnish




Method


For the broth, place the garlic, cream, coriander and chilli flakes into a small food processor and blend until smooth.


Pour the mixture into a large frying pan or wok and bring to the boil. Add the carrot batons and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until just tender.


Heat the vegetable oil in a separate frying pan, add the pak choi and fry for 1-2 minutes on each side. Place the pak choi pieces into two serving bowls and pour over the broth.


Meanwhile, for the crisp fried noodles, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Place the blanched noodles into the hot oil and fry for 1-2 minutes, or until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


To serve, place the crisp noodles on top of the broth in each bowl and garnish with coriander.
