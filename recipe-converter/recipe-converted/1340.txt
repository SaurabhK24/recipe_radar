Ingredients

5 tbsp olive oil
85g/3oz broad beans, out of their pods
½ onion, sliced
100g/3½oz feta cheese, crumbled
125g/4½oz cherry tomatoes, halved
½ tsp sugar
½ tsp salt
100g/3½oz new potatoes, sliced
1 tsp ground turmeric
25g/1oz butter
1 handful fresh parsley, chopped
1 handful fresh basil, chopped
1 handful fresh chives, chopped




Method


Heat two tablespoons of the oil in a pan and lightly fry the broad beans and onion for 6-8 minutes, or until onions aer softened. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly before stirring in the feta cheese.


Place half the tomatoes onto a plate and sprinkle over the sugar and salt. Place in the microwave for five minutes on a medium heat, or until dried. Remove from the microwave, drizzle over the remaining olive oil and allow to cool before stirring into the onion and broad bean mixture.


Parboil the new potato slices in boiling salted water seasoned with the ground turmeric for 5-6 minutes, then drain. Melt the butter in a pan and fry the potatoes for 5-6 minutes, or until tender and golden-brown.


To serve, place the fresh herbs onto a serving plate and pile on the broad bean, onion, feta and dried tomato mixture. Scatter over the remaining tomato halves, arrange the turmeric potatoes around the edge of the plate and drizzle over any remaining oil from the pan.
