This quick, easy pea hummus is lighter and fresher-tasting than the traditional chickpea version.

Ingredients

200g/7oz fresh peas
2 tbsp tahini
1-2 tbsp freshly squeezed lime juice
¼ tsp ground cumin
pinch salt, or to taste
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
1-2 spring onions, trimmed, finely chopped
vegetable crisps or tortilla chips, to serve




Method


Boil the peas in a pan of lightly salted water for 2-3 minutes, or until tender. Drain well, then rinse under cold running water.


Roughly crush half the peas and blend the remaining into a smooth purée using a hand-held blender.


Mix the crushed and pureed peas together in a bowl, then stir in the tahini, lime juice, cumin and salt, to taste. Stir in the coriander and spring onions.


Serve with vegetable crisps or tortilla chips.
