Small, warm almondy cakes are just the thing after a frosty Christmas walk. A little cream would be appropriate here.






By Nigel Slater


From Nigel Slater's 12 Tastes of Christmas






Ingredients

180g/6¼oz caster sugar
180g/6¼oz butter, softened
2 free-range eggs
80g/2¾oz plain flour
150g/5oz ground almonds
100g/3½oz marzipan, cut into 1cm/½in pieces
100g/3½oz blueberries
icing sugar, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Cut out squares of baking parchment that would easily cover the holes of a bun tray. Line each one.


Beat the sugar and butter together in a bowl with an electric mixer until pale and fluffy.


Gradually beat in the eggs, then gradually introduce the flour and ground almonds. Continue to beat until all is well incorporated.


Fold the marzipan into the mixture.


Divide the mixture between the lined cups of the bun tray. Scatter 3-4 berries over each one.


Bake the cakes for 30 minutes, or until springy to the touch.


Sprinkle with a little icing sugar and serve warm.
