Delicious cinnamon-baked plums atop a cobbler-style base.





By Clare Auger


From Country Show Cook Off






Ingredients

100g/3½oz butter, cut into pieces, plus extra for greasing
300g/10½oz self-raising flour, sifted
50g/1¾oz caster sugar
1 orange, zest and 2 tsp juice
150ml/¼ pint of milk

For the topping

700g/1lb 9oz plums, stoned and halved
50g/1¾oz butter
50g/1¾oz demerara sugar
2 tsp ground cinnamon




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Lightly grease a 23x33cm/9x13in Swiss roll tin. In a bowl rub the butter into the flour using your fingertips. Stir in the caster sugar and orange zest. Pour in the milk and mix using a flat knife blade until it is fully combined with the dry ingredients (add a little more milk if required).


Tip the mixture into the prepared tin and smooth the surface.


For the topping, place the plums on top, cut side up, and put a small dot of butter on top of each plum.


In a bowl, mix the demerara sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle over the plums and finish with a drizzle of orange juice.


Bake for approximately 20 minutes, or until the base is golden and plums are bubbling and juicy.
