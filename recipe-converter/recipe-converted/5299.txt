Ingredients

4 free-range eggs
300g/10½oz broccoli, cut in to florets
2 small leeks, about 300g/10½oz in total, trimmed, slit and thickly sliced
4 tbsp lemon juice
2 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp clear honey
1 tbsp capers, well drained
2 tbsp chopped tarragon
salt and freshly ground pepper




Method


Place the eggs in a large pot, cover with cold water and bring to the boil. Once the water is boiling cook for a further 7-10 minutes. When cooked plunge the eggs in ice-cold water for 1 minute, remove and set aside.


Meanwhile, place the broccoli in the top of a steamer, cook for 3 minutes. Add the leeks and cook for a further 2 minutes.


For the dressing, mix together the lemon juice, oil, honey, capers and tarragon in a salad bowl. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Shell and roughly chop the eggs.


Add the broccoli and leeks to the dressing and toss together. Sprinkle with the chopped eggs and serve.
