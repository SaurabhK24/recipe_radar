Ingredients
For the caramelised pineapple

½ pineapple, cored and cut into cubes
50g/1¾oz caster sugar

For the rice pudding

200ml/7fl oz milk
1 vanilla pod, seeds removed
30ml/1fl oz cream




Method


Place the pineapple cubes and caster sugar in a large bowl and mix together so that the pineapple is coated with the sugar.


Place a small frying pan over a medium heat and add the pineapple cubes and sugar to the pan. Cook for ten minutes, keeping the pineapple cubes moving as the sugar begins to caramelise evenly.


To make the rice pudding, place all of the ingredients into a medium saucepan and bring the mixture to the boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for eight minutes, stirring regularly, until the rice has softened.


To serve, place the rice pudding in a bowl and place the caramelised pineapple on top.
