Ingredients

4 tsp olive oil
1 red onion, thinly sliced
375g/13oz courgettes, diced
6 free-range eggs
2 tbsp chopped mint
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Heat the oil in a large, nonstick frying pan with a flameproof handle. Add the onion and courgettes and fry over gentle heat for 5 minutes, or until lightly browned and just cooked.


Preheat the grill to a hot setting.


Beat together the eggs, 2 tablespoons of water and chopped mint. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Add the egg mixture to the frying pan. Cook, without stirring, for 4-5 minutes, or until the frittata is almost set and the underside is golden brown.


Transfer the pan to a hot grill and cook for 3-4 minutes until the top is golden and the frittata is cooked through.


Cut into wedges and serve.
