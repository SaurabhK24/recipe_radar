Ingredients
For the crostini and parsley salad

2 tbsp olive oil
1 thick slice rye bread
50g/1¾oz goats' cheese
salt and freshly ground black pepper
large handful fresh parsley, leaves only
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar

For the aubergine crisps

150ml/¼ pt vegetable oil
150ml/¼ pt olive oil
½ aubergine, very thinly sliced
sea salt




Method


Preheat a griddle pan until hot. To make the salad, drizzle one tablespoon of the olive oil over the rye bread and placeon the hot griddle pan. Griddle for 1-2 minutes on each side until golden-brown.


Spread one side of the rye bread with goats' cheese, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and place under a hot grill for 2-3 minutes, or until beginning to turn golden-brown on top.


Place the parsley leaves into a serving bowl and dress with the remaining one tablespoon of olive oil and the balsamic vinegar. Place the goats' cheese crostini on top.


To make the aubergine crisps, pour the vegetable oil and olive oil into a deep, heavy-based saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Add the aubergine slices to the hot oil and fry gently for eight minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


To serve, scatter the aubergine crisps with sea salt and scatter around the crostini in the serving bowl.
