Ingredients
For the sponge

85g/3oz self-raising flour
30g/1oz cocoa powder
pinch salt
115g/4oz light muscovado sugar
115g/4oz unsalted butter, softened
1 tsp vanilla essence
2 free-range eggs, lightly beaten
2-3 tbsp milk

For the sauce

85g/3oz light muscovado sugar
30g/1oz cocoa powder
225ml/8fl oz milk




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Butter a 1-litre (2-pint) ovenproof dish.


To make the sponge, sift the flour into a bowl with the cocoa powder and salt.


In a separate bowl, cream together the sugar and butter until light and fluffy.


Beat in the vanilla essence and the eggs then fold this mixture in the flour mixture.


Mix in just enough milk to give a soft dropping consistency.


Spoon into the buttered ovenproof dish.


For the sauce, mix the sugar and the cocoa powder together and gradually beat in the milk.


Pour evenly over the uncooked cake mixture.


Place in the oven and bake for about 40-60 minutes until firm and spongy to touch.


Serve hot, warm or cold, with or without cream.
