Ingredients

3 sheets ready-made filo pastry
1 free-range egg, beaten with a pinch of salt added
1 jar ready-made mincemeat
pinch ground mixed spice
single cream, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Place a sheet of the filo on a large baking sheet and brush all over with the beaten egg. Place a second sheet of filo on top of the first and brush with egg, then top with the final filo sheet and brush with beaten egg.


Spoon the mincemeat along one edge of the layered filo sheets, then roll up the filo into a large sausage shape. Seal the edges securely, brushing with more beaten egg and dust lightly with the mixed spice.


Bake for about 8-10 minutes until the pastry is cooked through and golden-brown.


To serve, transfer to a serving plate and serve at the table with a jug of pouring cream alongside.
