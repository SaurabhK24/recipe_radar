Ingredients
For the pasta

½ large tin sweetcorn
200ml/7fl oz double cream
1 tbsp wholegrain mustard
½ vegetable stock cube
100ml/3½fl oz white wine
1 tbsp tomato purée
150g/5½oz penne pasta, cooked

For the crunchy spring onions

200ml/7fl oz oil, for deep frying
4 spring onions
110g/4oz self-raising flour
3-4 tbsp water

To serve

1 tbsp finely chopped chives
paprika, for dusting




Method


For the pasta, pour all of the ingredients except the pasta, into a pan and let it bubble for 2-3 minutes to reduce.


Meanwhile, heat the oil in a deep heavy-bottomed saucepan. It is ready when a breadcrumb dropped in will sizzle gently in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Mix the spring onion ingredients together in a bowl to form a thick batter. Drop the batter by spoonfuls into the hot oil for 1-2 minutes until golden. Drain on kitchen towels.


Stir the sauce through the pasta and garnish with chives, the crunchy spring onions and a dusting of paprika.
