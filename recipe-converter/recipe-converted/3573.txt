Ingredients
For the dover sole with shrimps

50g/1¾oz butter
1 shallot, finely chopped
1 tsp chopped blade of mace
½ tsp cayenne pepper
½ lemon, juice only
10g capers
5g fresh chives, chopped
5g fresh parsley, chopped
50g/1¾oz brown shrimp
salt and black pepper
1 dover sole, filleted
25g/1oz plain flour, seasoned with salt and pepper
2 tbsp olive oil

For the steamed asparagus

1 bunch asparagus, trimmed
2 tbsp unsalted butter




Method


For the shrimps, melt the butter In a frying pan. Add the shallot and cook until soft and translucent and the butter is a nut-brown colour. Stir in the mace and caynenne pepper. Cook for a couple of minutes then drain through a fine sieve or muslin. Return the liquid to the pan and add the lemon juice (take care as the fat will spit).


Stir the capers, chives, parsley and shrimps through the flavoured butter and season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside and keep warm.


For the dover sole, dust the sole in the seasoned flour. Heat a large frying pan until hot, add the oil and fry the sole on both sides for 2-3 minutes.


For the steamed asparagus, heat a saucepan with a small about of water in the bottom and place a bamboo steamer on top. Once the water is simmering, add the asparagus to the steamer and steam for 3-4 minutes.


Heat a medium frying pan and add the butter, once melted, add the steamed asparagus and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat the asparagus in the butter.


To serve, spoon the sauce over the sole and place the asparagus on the side.
