Ingredients

200g/7oz spaghetti, cooked according to packet instructions
1 tbsp grated parmesan
55g/2oz skinless salmon fillet, chopped
small bunch fresh parsley, chopped
3 free-range eggs, beaten
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil
fresh chives, chopped, to serve




Method


Place the spaghetti, parmesan, salmon and parsley into a bowl and add the eggs. Mix well to coat and season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Heat the oil in a 15cm/6in non-stick frying pan and add the egg mixture. Cook for 3-4 minutes, until the underside is golden brown.


Turn the frittata over by placing a large plate over the pan to cover it, then carefully turn over the pan to catch the frittata. Carefully return the frittata to the pan uncooked-side down and continue to cook for a further 2-3 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through.


Serve onto a clean plate, garnished with chives.
