Ingredients

1 skinless chicken breast, cut into chunks
1 courgette, cut into chunks
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp clear honey
salt and freshly ground black pepper
handful fresh flatleaf parsley leaves
dash balsamic vinegar




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Heat an ovenproof griddle pan until very hot. Soak two bamboo skewers in water for a few minutes.


Thread the chicken and courgette onto the bamboo skewers. Brush the griddle pan with a little of the oil and place the chicken skewers into the pan.


Drizzle over most of the remaining oil. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper and griddle for a few minutes, turning frequently until lightly charred all over.


Drizzle the honey over the skewers and transfer to the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until the chicken skewers are cooked through and lightly caramelised.


Place the parsley leaves into a bowl and drizzle with the remaining oil and the balsamic vinegar.


To serve, place the chicken skewers onto a warmed plate and scatter over the dressed herbs.
