Ingredients

200g/9oz basmati rice
200ml/7fl oz whole milk
100ml/3½fl oz double cream
3 tbsp caster sugar
2 green cardamon pods, lightly crushed
1 passion fruit, pulp scraped out
1 lime, juice and zest only
brown sugar, for sprinkling
fresh mint leaves, to garnish




Method


Place the rice in a medium saucepan, pour in enough water to cover and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for five minutes.


Add the milk, cream, sugar and cardamom pods and simmer over a gentle heat until the rice is tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed.


Stir in the passion fruit pulp, lime juice and zest and a little more cream if the mixture is too dry.


To serve, spoon the pudding into two serving dishes. Sprinkle with brown sugar and garnish with mint leaves.
