Ingredients
For the herb-crusted beef

1 x 100g/3½oz beef fillet
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp chopped fresh chervil
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
50g/1½oz fresh breadcrumbs

For the borlotti bean salad

1 tbsp olive oil
½ lemon, zest and juice only
75g/2¾oz tinned borlotti beans, drained
handful fresh parsley
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the herb-crusted beef, rub the beef with a little of the oil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Place the herbs and breadcrumbs into a bowl and mix well, then coat the beef in the breadcrumb mixture.


Heat the remaining oil in an ovenproof frying pan and fry the beef for 3-4 minutes on each side.


Transfer the pan to the oven and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until golden-brown and cooked to your liking. Remove from the oven and allow to rest.


For the borlotti bean salad, place the oil and lemon zest and juice into a bowl and mix well. Add the beans and parsley, mix well and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, place the herb-crusted beef onto a plate with the salad alongside.
