Ingredients

calorie controlled cooking oil spray
1 medium onion, sliced
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
2 celery sticks, trimmed and thinly sliced
2 medium carrots or 2 yellow peppers, cut into 2cm/1in chunks
400g/14oz tin chopped tomatoes
1 vegetable stock cube
1 tsp dried mixed herbs
400g/14oz tin butter beans, drained and rinsed
1 head young spring greens (approximately 125g/4½oz), trimmed and sliced
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Spray a large non-stick saucepan with oil and cook the onion, garlic, celery and carrots or peppers gently for 10 minutes, stirring regularly until softened.


Add 750ml/26fl oz water and the chopped tomatoes. Crumble over the stock cube and stir in the dried herbs. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes.


Season the soup with salt and pepper and add the spring greens and butterbeans. Return to a gentle simmer and cook for a further 3-4 minutes or until the greens are softened. Season to taste and serve in deep bowls.
