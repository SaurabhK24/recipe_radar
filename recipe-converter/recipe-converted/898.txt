Ingredients
For the venison carpaccio

1 tbsp olive oil
85g/3oz venison loin
3 tbsp chopped fresh coriander

For the dressing

2 tbsp honey
1 lemon, juice only
1 tbsp Dijon mustard
3 tbsp olive oil




Method


For the venison carpaccio, rub the oil into the meat and sear in a very hot pan for about one minute, turning to brown all sides. Remove from the pan and leave to rest for 4-5 minutes, then slice very thinly with a sharp knife and arrange in a single layer on a serving plate. Sprinkle over the chopped coriander.


For the dressing, place all of the dressing ingredients together in a bowl and whisk well to combine.


To serve, drizzle the dressing over the venison carpaccio and serve immediately.
