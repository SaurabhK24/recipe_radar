Ingredients

110g/4oz bean thread (transparent) noodles
1 tbsp groundnut (peanut) oil
3 tbsp spring onion, finely chopped
2 tbsp garlic, finely chopped
450g/1lb minced beef

For the sauce

455ml/16flo oz chicken stock
1½ tbsp chilli bean sauce
1 tbsp whole yellow bean sauce
2 tbsp light soy sauce
2 tsp dark soy sauce
½ tsp salt
½ tsp freshly ground black pepper
2 tsp sesame oil
2 tsp spring onions, coarsely chopped




Method


Soak the noodles in a large bowl of warm water for 15 minutes. When soft drain and discard the water. Cut into 7.5cm/2in lengths using scissors or a knife.


Heat a wok or large frying pan until it is very hot. Add the oil and when it is very hot and slightly smoking, add the spring onions and garlic and stir fry for 15 seconds. Add the meat and stir fry for 8 minutes or until it is cooked.


Add all the sauce ingredients except the sesame oil and cook over a gentle heat for about 5 minutes. Now add the drained noodles and sesame oil and cook for a further 5 minutes or until most of the liquid has evaporated. Ladle the noodles into individual bowls, garnish with the spring onions and serve at once.
