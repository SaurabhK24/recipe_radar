Ingredients

170g/6oz boiled and diced new potatoes
55g/2oz Raclette cheese or Abondance
2 tbsp grain mustard
Â½ head of frisee lettuce
1 red pepper
3 tbsp balsamic vinegar
6 tbsp olive oil
fresh basil
fresh rosemary
salt
freshly ground black pepper

For the tapenade

black olives
1 clove garlic
1 onion
1 lemon, juice only
3 tbsp capers
6 anchovy fillets
flat leaf parsley chopped
extra virgin olive oil




Method


Cut the red pepper in half, remove the seeds and top, and place on an oven tray. Drizzle the red pepper with olive oil and bake in a hot oven until brown on the top. Remove from the oven and place in a bowl while still hot and cover with cling film to allow cooling.


Peel the skin off the cooled pepper and dice the flesh, then mix with the balsamic vinegar, olive oil, seasoning and finely chopped fresh rosemary. Place in the microwave for about 30 seconds to warm up and then press peppers and potatoes into some 5cm/2in stainless steel rings. Top this with some grated cheese and place under a hot grill to brown the top.


Place a small pile of lettuce on the middle of the plate and the ring of potato and cheese on the top, remove the stainless steel ring. Spoon a pile of the tapenade on top of the cheese. Chop some fresh basil and add into the dressing.


Check for seasoning again and spoon around the edge of the plate and serve.
