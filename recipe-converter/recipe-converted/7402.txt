Ingredients
For the pancakes

200ml/8fl oz whole milk
2 free-range eggs
110g/4oz plain flour
pinch salt
1 tbsp melted butter
small knob of butter

For the sauce

peach half from a can, chopped
syrup from a can of peaches
large handful dried cranberries




Method


For the pancakes, place all of the pancake ingredients, except for the knob of butter, into a food processor and blend to make a smooth batter.


Melt the small knob of butter in a crêpe pan over a medium to high heat and spoon a quarter of the batter mixture onto the hot pan, swirling around to cover the pan base. Cook for 30 seconds on each side, or until golden and cooked.


Transfer to a plate and fold in half and then in half again.


For the sauce, heat the ingredients in a small frying pan until the liquid has reduced and thickened.


Pour over the pancakes to serve.
