Ingredients
For the Thai-style beef salad

2 tbsp soy sauce
few drops Tabasco sauce
1 lime, juice only
2 tbsp sesame seeds
¼ tsp dried chilli flakes
85g/3oz rump steak
1 tbsp vegetable oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
100g/3½oz green beans

For the yoghurt and coriander dressing

3 tbsp yoghurt
1 tbsp sesame seeds
1 tbsp sesame oil
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander, to garnish




Method


For the Thai-style beef salad, mix the soy sauce, Tabasco sauce, lime juice, sesame seeds and chilli flakes together in a bowl. Set aside.


Heat a griddle pan until hot. Rub the steak with the oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fry the steak for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking, then pour over half of the soy sauce mixture. Remove from the heat and allow the steak to rest.


Blanch the green beans in boiling salted water for 3-4 minutes and then refresh in cold water. Drain and arrange on a plate.


For the dressing, whisk together the yoghurt, sesame seeds and sesame oil and remaining soy mixture in a bowl until well-combined.


To serve, spoon the dressing over the beans and place the steak on top. Sprinkle over the chopped fresh coriander.
