Ingredients

350g/12oz Greek yoghurt
1 cucumber
2 tbsp lemon juice
2 cloves of garlic, grated finely
dash of extra virgin olive oil
paprika, for sprinkling




Method


The best result is achieved by peeling and de-seeding the cucumber before grating. Hang the grated cucumber in muslin cloth or a tea towel in order to squeeze out all the excess liquid.


Combine the yoghurt, cucumber, lemon juice and garlic. Add a dash of olive oil and sprinkle with paprika.


Perfect for dipping your aubergines in. (See recipe for puréed Aubergine and Garlic Dip.)
