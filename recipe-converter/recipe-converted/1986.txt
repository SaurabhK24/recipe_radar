A little tomato and feta skewer makes an easy vegetarian nibble that fits in at any buffet party.






By Merrilees Parker


From Saturday Kitchen






Ingredients

350g/12oz feta (enough to make 40 squares)
120ml/4fl oz extra virgin olive oil
1 unwaxed lemon, zest only
2 tsp freshly chopped oregano
1 tsp cracked black pepper
40 cherry tomatoes
large bunch of basil
40 long skewers




Method


Cut the feta into 40 even squares and place in a bowl. Pour over the olive oil; add the lemon zest, oregano and cracked black pepper. Leave to marinate for at least 2 hours or preferably overnight.


To assemble, take a skewer and place a cherry tomato first, follow with a cube of the feta. You could prepare the skewers to this stage in advance, just keep refrigerated.


Finish each one with a basil leaf. Skewer one tip of the leaf then the other tip so it looks like a little sail. Repeat until you have forty skewers.
