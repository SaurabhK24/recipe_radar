Ingredients

2 tbsp plain flour
20g/¾oz butter
1 tsp demerara sugar
1 heaped tbsp rolled oats
1 ripe nectarine, halved, stone removed
2 tbsp orange juice
plain yoghurt, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/450F/Gas 7.


Rub the flour and butter together in a bowl using your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Stir in the demerara sugar, then the oats.


Lay the nectarine halves in an ovenproof dish, cut sides facing upwards. Pour in the orange juice. Pile the crumble topping onto the cut surfaces of the nectarines.


Place the ovenproof dish onto a baking tray. Transfer to the oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the nectarines have softened and the crumble is crunchy and golden-brown.


Serve on small plates with plain yoghurt.
