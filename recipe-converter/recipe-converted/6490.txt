Method


For the dressing, blend the mustard, spices and honey in a food processor, until very smooth.


Gradually add the vinegar, then, with the motor running, add the oil and rosewater slowly to emulsify.


Add mint and parsley, season well. Set aside.


Stir the courgettes and the oil together in a mixing bowl until the courgettes are coated.


Preheat a griddle pan over a medium-high heat. Add the courgettes and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side until slightly softened. Set aside on kitchen paper to cool.


For the salad, add the griddled courgettes and the remaining salad ingredients into a bowl.


To serve, add dressing to taste.
