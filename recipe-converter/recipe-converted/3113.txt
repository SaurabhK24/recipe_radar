Ingredients
For the stuffing

1 large handful slightly stale, rustic-style bread, torn into pieces
large handful hazelnuts
1 lemon, zest and juice
125g/4oz butter, cut into small cubes
2 garlic cloves, chopped
splash pastis
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
large handful fresh parsley leaves, chopped

For the crayfish

30 raw signal crayfish (substitute with langoustines if unavailable)
lemon wedges, to serve




Method


Preheat the grill to its highest setting.


Place the bread into a food processor and blend into medium-sized breadcrumbs.


Add the remaining stuffing ingredients, except for the parsley, to the breadcrumbs and blend until thoroughly combined. (If it becomes a lump, remove the lid and break it up a little with a spoon.) Stir in the chopped parsely.


For the crayfish, using a sharp knife, cut all of the crayfish lengthways from tip to tail. Remove any waste sacs from the crayfish.


Arrange the crayfish, side-by-side, on a roasting tray. Smear up a generous amount of the stuffing onto the flesh side of each crayfish half.


Sprinkle the crayfish with salt and place under the grill. Grill for 4-5 minutes, or until completely cooked through. The shells will turn completely red when cooked. If there are any remaining signs of dark brown or blue colouring, they are not ready and require a few minutes more.


To serve, transfer the cooked crayfish to a plate, and arrange in rows. Serve with lemon wedges.
