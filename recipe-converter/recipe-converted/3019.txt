Ingredients
For the couscous

2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing
200g/7oz couscous
30g/1oz dried apricots, chopped
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
squeeze lemon juice
salt and freshly ground black pepper
300ml/10½fl oz hot chicken or vegetable stock
30g/1oz brazil nuts, chopped

To serve

small handful fresh basil, to garnish




Method


For the couscous, heat the olive oil in a saucepan, add the couscous and stir well to coat in the oil. Keep stirring over a medium heat for 2-3 minutes, then add the rest of the ingredients and cook over a low heat, stirring occasionally, until the stock has been absorbed and the couscous is tender. Fluff up the couscous with a fork.


Press the couscous into a lightly oiled ramekin, and turn out onto a serving plate. Garnish with the basil leaves and serve.
