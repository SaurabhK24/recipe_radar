Ingredients

80g/3oz mixed dried exotic fruit, (such as mango, papaya, banana, fig, golden raisins), chopped
55ml/2fl oz brandy
30g/1oz soft light brown sugar
½ tsp allspice
100g/3½oz butter, plus extra for spreading
6 eating apples, cored
200g/7oz Greek yoghurt, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.


Place the mixed dried fruit and the brandy into a bowl and leave to soak for at least two hours, but ideally overnight.


After soaking, add the sugar, allspice and butter to the brandy-soaked fruit.


Spoon the fruit mixture into the holes in the cored apples, pressing in to fill well and spread some more butter over the apples.


Place the stuffed apples into an ovenproof dish, cover with aluminium foil and transfer to the oven to bake for 40 minutes.


Remove the foil and cook 15-20 minutes more, until the apples are soft, but not collapsing.


Place onto plates and serve with a dollop of Greek yoghurt.
