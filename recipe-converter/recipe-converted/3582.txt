80ml/3fl oz clear honey
250g/9oz rolled porridge oats
80g/3oz dried cherries
80g/3oz dried cranberries

For the chocolate dipping sauce

Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/360F/Gas 4.


Melt the butter, sugar and honey together in a pan over a medium heat.


Add the rolled oats, dried cherries, dried cranberries, desiccated coconut and hazelnuts and stir well.


Pour the flapjack mixture into a greased 30cm/12in x 20cm/8in square baking tin. Press the mixture into the corners and smooth the top.


Place into the oven to bake for 20 minutes, or until golden-brown and bubbling.


Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Turn out of the tin and cut into equal-sized squares.


For the chocolate dipping sauce, heat the cream in a pan until warmed through. Stir in the chocolate pieces until melted and smooth, then stir in the brandy.


Serve the flapjacks with the dipping sauce in a small bowl alongside.
