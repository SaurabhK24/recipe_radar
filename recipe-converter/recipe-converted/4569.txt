Ingredients
For the griddled chilli goats&#39; cheese

100g/3½oz goats' cheese, cut into two equal discs
olive oil
pinch dried chilli flakes
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the pineapple and coriander dressing

dash olive oil
¼ baby pineapple, finely chopped
pinch dried chilli flakes
1 tsp balsamic vinegar
1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
fresh flatleaf parsley leaves, to garnish




Method


For the griddled goats' cheese, drizzle the goats' cheese halves with olive oil and sprinkle with chilli flakes, salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Heat a griddle pan until hot, add the goats' cheese and griddle until the cheese is just beginning to melt, but it is still retaining its shape. Remove from the heat and keep warm.


For the dressing, heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the chopped pineapple and fry for 3-4 minutes. Add the chilli flakes and balsamic vinegar and fry for 1-2 minutes. Add the chopped coriander and stir well.


To serve, place a pile of flatleaf parsley onto a serving plate. Place the griddled goats' cheese on top and pour over the dressing.
