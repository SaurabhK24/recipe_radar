Try James Martin's super easy recipe for a rich, moist honey cake: perfect with a cuppa.






By James Martin






Ingredients

170g/6oz clear honey
140g/5oz butter
85g/3oz light muscovado sugar
2 eggs, beaten
200g/7oz self raising flour, sieved
water

For the icing

55g/2oz icing sugar
1 tbsp clear honey
hot water




Method


Preheat oven to 180C/350F/Gas 3 and butter and line the bottom of a 7in/18cm cake tin.


Measure the honey, butter and sugar into a large pan. Add a tablespoon of water and heat gently until melted.


Remove from the heat and mix in the eggs and flour.


Spoon into the cake tin and bake for 40-45 minutes until the cake is springy to the touch and shrinking slightly from the sides of the tin.


Cool slightly in the tin before turning out onto a wire rack.


While the cake is still warm, make the icing by mixing the sugar and honey together with 2-3 teaspoons of hot water. Trickle over the cake in whatever design takes your fancy.
