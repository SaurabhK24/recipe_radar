Ingredients

100ml/4fl oz double cream
4 free-range egg yolks
2 tbsp caster sugar
½ vanilla pod, split, seeds scraped out
110g/4oz egg noodles, cooked according to packet instructions
½ mango, peeled and chopped
ground cinnamon, to dust




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Pour the cream into a saucepan and place over a medium heat. Bring to the boil and remove from the heat.


Place the egg yolks, sugar and vanilla seeds into a bowl and whisk until pale.


Gradually add the cream to the egg yolk mixture, whisking all the time to avoid the eggs cooking.


Return the custard mixture to the saucepan and stir over a gentle heat until thickened.


Addthe noodles into the custard mix, then pour into a small gratin dish.


Place the mango on top and dust lightly with ground cinnamon.


Place the gratin dish into the oven and bake for ten minutes, then let it rest for ten minutes before serving.
