Ingredients

2 tbsp olive oil
2 parsnips, cut lengthways into eight pieces
pinch dried chilli flakes
drizzle maple syrup
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7. Drizzle the olive oil into a roasting tin and place in the oven until hot.


Blanch the parsnips in a pan of boiling salted water for 2-3 minutes, then drain well.


Remove the roasting tin from the oven, add the parsnips and stir to coat with the hot oil. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper then add the chilli and maple syrup. Stir until evenly coated, then roast in the oven for 15-20 minutes until tender in the middle and golden brown on the outside.


Transfer to a warm serving dish and serve at once.
