Ingredients
For the pancakes

2 free-range eggs
150g/5oz plain flour
50ml/2fl oz milk
250g/9oz dried lentils, cooked according to packet instructions
1 tbsp vegetable oil

For the vegetable filling

1 tbsp rapeseed oil
½ onion, roughly chopped
1 garlic clove, chopped
1 green pepper, seeds removed, sliced
200g/7oz mushrooms, sliced
handful fresh parsley, chopped
100g/3½oz cheddar cheese, grated
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the pancakes, place the eggs, flour and milk in a large bowl and whisk together to make a thick and smooth batter.


Add the lentils, stir well and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Heat the oil in a frying pan and slowly pour in enough batter to coat the bottom of the pan. Fry for two minutes, or until golden-brown underneath, then carefully turn the pancake over and fry the other side for a further two minutes. Repeat with the remaining batter.


For the filling, heat the rapeseed oil in a frying pan add the onion and garlic and cook until softened.


Add the green pepper and mushrooms and fry until the mushrooms are soft. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir through the chopped parsley.


To serve, place the pancake onto a warm plate, spoon over the vegetable filling into the centre and sprinkle over the cheese.
