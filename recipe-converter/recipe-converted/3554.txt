Ingredients

300ml/½ pint hot vegetable stock
200g/7oz basmati rice, rinsed
2 bird's-eye chillies, finely chopped
3 tbsp fresh peas, or frozen peas, defrosted
handful each fresh parsley, chives, basil, chopped
2 tbsp sesame oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
olive oil, for greasing




Method


Place the stock, rice and chillies into a pan, bring to the boil and cook for 7-8 minutes.


Add the peas and cook for a further 3-4 minutes, or until the rice and peas are tender. Drain off any excess liquid and stir in the herbs and sesame oil. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, lightly oil a small bowl and fill with the rice. Press the rice down into the bowl, then turn out onto a serving plate.
