Ingredients
For the millefeuille

1 sheet ready-rolled puff pastry
2 tbsp icing sugar

For the filling

3 tbsp mascarpone cheese
2 tbsp double cream
½ orange, zest only
½ vanilla pod, seeds only
1 tbsp icing sugar
3 fresh basil leaves, torn
2 figs, sliced
3 tbsp canned cherry syrup, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Using a sharp knife, cut out three triangles from the pastry and lay on a non-stick baking tray. Sprinkle with icing sugar and place in the oven for 5-6 minutes, or until golden-brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.


For the filling, combine the mascarpone cheese, double cream, orange zest, vanilla seeds, icing sugar and basil leaves in a bowl.


Arrange the sliced figs on a serving plate.


Take the cooled pastry triangles and split in half horizontally. Place one pastry triangle in the centre of the serving plate, spoon some of the cream mixture on top and repeat with the remaining pastry and cream, finishing with a final layer of pastry. Drizzle the cherry syrup round the edge to decorate.
