Ingredients

2 large aubergines
4 garlic cloves, 2 thinly sliced and 2 crushed
1 lemon, juice only
2 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp finely chopped parsley
2 tbsp finely chopped mint
50g/1¾oz walnuts, finely chopped

To serve

blinis
sour cream
pomegranate seeds




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.


Cut deep slits in the aubergines at regular intervals and on all sides. Stuff with the sliced garlic. Put on a baking tray and roast in the oven for 45 - 60 minutes. When the aubergines are ready, they should be soft, wrinkly and turning brown/black in colour.


Put the aubergines in a colander and allow to cool a little. When they are cold enough to handle, peel off the skin. Squeeze gently to remove as much liquid as possible. Chop the aubergines finely.


Put the aubergines in a bowl and add all of the remaining ingredients. Mix thoroughly. If you want a slightly smoother texture, you can use a stick blender or food processor.


Serve with blinis and sour cream, with a few pomegranate seeds sprinkled over.
