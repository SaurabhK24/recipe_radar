Ingredients

400g/14oz mouli (also known as white radish or daikon)
¼ white onion
flaked sea salt
1 tsp anchovy sauce
½ tsp sesame oil
½ tsp apple vinegar
¼ tsp fermented shrimps
1 tsp sugar
1½ heaped tsp gochugaru (Korean red chilli powder)
2 spring onions
½ tsp black sesame seeds (optional)




Method


Thinly slice the mouli into julienne strips, thinly slice the onion and place both in a bowl. Sprinkle with sea salt and leave for ten minutes.


Add the anchovy sauce, sesame oil, apple vinegar, fermented shrimps, sugar and chilli powder to a small bowl. Add the mixture to the mouli and onion and mix thoroughly so that it is all coated.


Chop the spring onions in half and then each half into quarters lengthways. Add to the mouli, sprinkle the sesame seeds over (if using) and serve.
