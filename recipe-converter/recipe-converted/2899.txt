Ingredients

700g/1½lb, approximately 24 small, even-sized shallots, peeled and left whole (ones that split into twins count as 2)
55ml/2fl oz red wine vinegar
400ml/14fl oz dry red wine
1 tsp sugar
salt




Method


Use a wide, shallow saucepan which will take the shallots in one layer, then simply place all the above ingredients except the sugar in it and bring everything up to simmering point. Then turn the heat down to its lowest setting and let the shallots simmer (just a few bubbles breaking the surface) for 1-1¼ hours. Turn the shallots over at half-time, and 10 minutes before the end of the cooking time sprinkle in the sugar. You should end up with tender shallots glistening with a lovely glaze. If your heat source is not low enough, you may need to use a diffuser. If it's more convenient you can cook the shallots in advance, and gently re-heat them before serving.
