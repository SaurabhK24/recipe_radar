This is the way to cook halloumi. It is very popular done on a barbecue as a vegetarian burger, but served like this, dusted in semolina, fried in olive oil and drizzled with warm honey, black sesame seeds and oregano, it is one of the best mezzes I know. If you can get kefalotiri cheese, try that; it is very special too.
