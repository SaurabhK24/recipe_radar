Ingredients

170g/6oz self-raising wholemeal flour
170g/6oz plain flour
½ tsp salt
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
290ml/½ pint buttermilk




Method


Preheat the oven to 400F/200C/Gas 6.


Tip the flours, salt and bicarbonate of soda into a large mixing bowl and stir.


Make a well in the centre and pour in the buttermilk, mixing quickly with a large fork to form a soft dough. (Depending upon the absorbency of the flour, you may need to add a little milk if the dough seems too stiff but it should not be too wet or sticky.)


Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly.


Form into a round and flatten the dough slightly before placing on a lightly floured baking sheet.


Cut a cross on the top and bake for about 30 minutes or until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Cool on a wire rack.
