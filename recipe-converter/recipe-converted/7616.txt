Savour the taste of summery cherry tomatoes by packing them into a jar with garlic, herbs and spices and a sweet and vinegary pickling liquid.

  Equipment and preparation: you will need a 1 litre/1¾ pint pickling jar with a screw top lid (or several smaller jars with lids).

Ingredients
For the pickling liquid

250ml/9fl oz malt vinegar
250ml/9fl oz red wine vinegar
5 tbsp golden caster sugar
3 tbsp sea salt

For the pickle

20 assorted cherry or small tomatoes
4 garlic cloves
2 large sprigs rosemary
1 bay leaf
1 tbsp coriander seeds
1 tbsp black peppercorns




Method


For the pickling liquid, in a pan bring all of the pickling liquid ingredients to the boil and leave to simmer on a low heat.


Sterilise both a 1 litre/1¾ pint pickling jar with a screw top lid and the lid in a large pot of boiling water that boils for at least 10 minutes. (Or use several smaller jars with lids.) Lift the jars out of their water bath with a pair of jar tongs. Empty the water.


Alternatively they can be sterilised in a dishwasher.


For the pickle, quickly fill the jars with the tomatoes, herbs and spices.


Using a jug or a funnel pour the hot pickling liquid into the jar, pour it all the way to the top and seal, ensuring as little air as possible remains in the jar.


The pickle will keep for up to a year.


Keep refrigerated once opened and finish within two weeks.
