Ingredients
For the soup

1 tbsp olive oil
½ onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed to a paste in a mortar and pestle
100g/3½ oz fresh peas
400ml/14fl oz chicken or vegetable stock
2 tbsp chopped fresh mint
3 tbsp double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the soft poached egg

3 tbsp white wine vinegar
1 free-range egg




Method


For the soup, heat the olive oil in a pan and gently fry the onion and garlic for 3-4 minutes, or until softened. Add the peas and stock and leave to simmer for 4-5 minutes, or until the peas are tender.


Stir in the mint and cream and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Using a stick blender, process the soup until smooth. Keep warm.


For the soft poached egg, bring a pan of water to the boil, then add the vinegar and reduce to a gentle simmer. Crack the egg into a bowl. Using a ladle, swirl the water in the pan to create a whirlpool, then carefully pour the egg into the centre of the whirlpool. Poach for 2-3 minutes, or until the whites are just set, then remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


To serve, spoon the soup into a bowl and top with the poached egg.
