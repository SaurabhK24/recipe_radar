Ingredients

1 bunch asparagus, trimmed
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 garlic clove, chopped
sprig fresh rosemary
sprig fresh thyme
10cm x 15cm/4in x 6in rectangle ready-rolled puff pastry
100g/3½oz goats' cheese, crumbled




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Rub the asparagus with olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Heat a griddle pan until hot, then griddle the asparagus with the garlic and herbs until chargrilled all over. Remove from the pan, discard the rosemary and thyme sprigs and set aside.


Score a border 1cm/½in around the edge of the pastry and prick inside the border with a fork.


Place the pastry onto a baking sheet and bake in the oven for five minutes, or until the pastry is beginning to turn golden-brown and is slightly risen.


Place the goats' cheese onto the middle of the pastry and top with the griddled asparagus.


Transfer to the oven and bake for 12-15 minutes.


To serve, place onto a serving plate.
