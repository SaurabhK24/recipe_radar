Ingredients

2 slices rye bread
2 tsp wholegrain mustard
85g/3oz Emmental cheese, grated
1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
6 fresh basil leaves, torn
2 canned plum tomatoes, cut into quarters




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Lightly toast the bread on a baking sheet in the oven. Remove and spread the mustard on one side of the toast.


In a bowl, mix together the grated cheese, Worcestershire sauce and basil leaves, then pile onto the toast, followed by the chopped tomatoes. Return to the oven to cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbling.


Cut each piece in half and serve immediately.
