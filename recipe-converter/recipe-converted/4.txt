100g/3½oz pork fillet

For the leeks

2 tbsp olive oil
¼ leek, finely sliced
¼ red pepper, finely chopped
4-5 drops Tabasco sauce

Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the pork, heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan and season the meat with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fry on all sides for 2-3 minutes, or until browned all over. Transfer to the oven to roast for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Set aside on a warm plate to rest.


For the leeks, heat the oil in a pan and fry the leeks and red pepper for 3-4 minutes, or until softened, then add the Tabasco sauce and stock and cook for a further 4-5 minutes.


For the dressing, place all of the dressing ingredients into a pan and warm through for 4-5 minutes, mixing well to combine.


Spoon the leeks onto a serving plate, slice the pork into thick medallions and place on top of the leeks. Spoon the dressing over the pork and around the edges of the plate and garnish with fresh parsley.
