Hot, quick and tasty - an easy storecupboard pasta dish for a weeknight supper.





By Max Beesley


From A Taste of My Life






Ingredients

6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus an extra dash for cooking the pasta
2 medium hot chillies, finely sliced
2 garlic cloves, chopped
handful basil leaves
600g/1lb 5oz canned chopped tomato
salt, to taste
400g/14oz fresh penne pasta
parmesan shavings (or similar vegetarian hard cheese), to serve




Method


Heat the olive oil in a frying pan. Add the chilli and garlic to the pan. After about a minute, add the basil leaves and gently wilt them in the flavoured oil.


Remove the garlic, basil and chilli from the pan and set aside. Add the chopped tomatoes to the frying pan.


Put the garlic, basil and chilli back in the pan with the tomatoes. Simmer for at least 10 minutes, until the sauce has thickened a little. Add salt to taste.


Meanwhile, cook the pasta for a few minutes in large saucepan of boiling, salted water with a dash of olive oil. Drain the pasta and the tomato sauce to it. Serve with shavings of parmesan.
