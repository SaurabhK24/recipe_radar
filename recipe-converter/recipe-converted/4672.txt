Ingredients
For the grilled lamb

200g/7oz lamb leg steak
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
sprig fresh thyme
sprig fresh rosemary
2 garlic cloves, lightly crushed

For the fondant potatoes

50g/2oz butter
Â½ large potato, peeled and cut into slices around 2.5cm/1in thick
salt and freshly ground black pepper
splash water

For the slow-roasted tomatoes

3 tomatoes, halved
1 tbsp olive oil
2 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only
2 garlic cloves, lightly crushed




Method


For the grilled lamb, flatten the lamb steak slightly using a rolling pin or meat mallet.


Rub the lamb with olive oil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Heat a griddle pan until smoking hot and place the lamb, thyme, rosemary and garlic onto the griddle. Griddle the lamb for 4-5 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking. Set aside and leave to rest for five minutes.


For the fondant potatoes, heat the butter in a frying pan, add the potatoes and a splash of water and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook over a low heat, turning occasionally, for 12-14 minutes, or until golden-brown and tender.


For the slow-roasted tomatoes, heat a griddle pan, place the halved tomatoes cut-side down in the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes. Turn over, sprinkle over the oil, thyme and garlic and cook over a low heat for five minutes.


To serve, place the lamb in the middle of a serving plate with the fondant potatoes and tomatoes.
