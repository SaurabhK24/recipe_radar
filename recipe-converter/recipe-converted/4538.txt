Homemade Thai curry paste has tonnes more flavour that shop-bought versions. Make double the recipe and freeze half for later.






By Jo' Pratt






Ingredients

4-6 medium green chillies, de-seeded and roughly chopped
2 shallots, roughly chopped
5cm/2in piece of fresh ginger, peeled and grated
2 garlic cloves, crushed
small bunch of fresh coriander, stalks and roots attached if possible
2 lemongrass stalks, chopped (if unavailable, use 2 tbsp dried)
1 lime, grated zest and juice
8 kaffir lime leaves, torn into pieces (if unavailable, use the grated zest of 1 extra lime)
2.5cm/1in piece galangal, peeled and chopped (if available)
1 tbsp coriander seeds, crushed
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp black peppercorns, crushed
2 tsp Thai fish sauce or light soy sauce
3 tbsp olive oil




Method


Place all of the ingredients in a food processor and blitz to a paste. Use straight away or store in a jar in the fridge for up to 3 weeks. This quantity is enough for a curry for 8 people.




Recipe Tips
When your curry is cooked, if you think it is too spicy, add some more sugar; if it isn't spicy enough, fry a little more curry paste in some oil for a minute or two and add to the sauce.
