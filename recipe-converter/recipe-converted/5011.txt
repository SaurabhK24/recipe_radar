Ingredients
For the honey and sesame chicken skewers

1 chicken breast, skinned and cut into 1in cubes
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp honey
1½ tbsp sesame seeds
1 tbsp olive oil

For the griddled squash

1 tbsp olive oil
½ butternut squash, par-boiled for 5 minutes and drained
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the spicy curly kale

1 tbsp olive oil
3 spring onions, finely chopped
125g/4½oz curly kale, chopped
3tbsp white wine
1 tbsp dried chilli flakes
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


To make the chicken skewers, season the chicken pieces with salt and freshly ground plack pepper. Thread the chicken pieces onto two or three skewers. Drizzle with honey, sprinkle with sesame seeds and finally drizzle with olive oil.


Heat a griddle pan until smoking hot and add the chicken skewers. Cook for 4-5 minutes, turning frequently until they are golden brown all over and the chicken is cooked through.


To make the griddled butternut squash, cut the squash into cubes, brush the squash with olive oil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a griddle pan until smoking hot and cook for 3 minutes on each side, until tender.


To make the spicy curly kale, heat the olive oil in a sauté pan and add the spring onions. Cook gently until softened slightly, add the curly kale and cook for another minute, stirring frequently.


Add the white wine, chilli flakes, salt and freshly ground black pepper and leave to cook for five minutes or until all the liquid has been absorbed.


To serve, put a large pile of spicy curly kale on a large plate, top with the chicken skewers and place the griddled butternut squash on the side.
