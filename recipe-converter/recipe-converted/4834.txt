Ingredients

10g/1/3oz sesame seeds
1 tsp nigella seeds
10g/1/3oz cumin seeds
30g/1oz hazelnuts
pinch chilli flakes
1 garlic clove
2 tsp sea salt
75g/3oz tahini
50ml/2fl oz olive oil
2 lemons, juice only
1 heaped tsp sumac
1 tbsp chopped fresh mint
1 tbsp olive oil
50g/2oz butter
20 raw king prawns

To serve

Lebanese or Turkish flatbreads
1 lemon, cut into wedges
pickled chillies




Method


Place the sesame, nigella, cumin seeds and hazelnuts in a dry frying pan over a medium heat. Cook for 2-4 minutes, stirring until fragrant and lightly toasted.


Place the seeds in a pestle and mortar. Add the chilli, garlic and salt and grind until smooth.


Place the tahini, 50ml/2fl oz of the olive oil, the lemon juice, sumac and mint in a bowl. Add the spice mixture and stir until well combined. If the sauce is too thick, loosen it with a little water.


Heat the remaining oil and the butter in a large heavy-based frying pan. Add the prawns and fry for 4-5 minutes, or until pink all over.


Add the sauce and cook the prawns for a further two minutes.


Serve the prawns on a flatbread with a lemon wedge and pickled chillies.
