Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
½ red onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
100ml/3fl oz white wine
250g/9oz cooked brown rice
150ml/¼ pint hot chicken stock (vegetarians can substitute vegetable stock)
50g/2oz edamame beans, pods removed
25g/1oz butter
30g/1oz Manchego cheese, grated, plus extra to serve
1 tbsp sun-blushed tomatoes
1 tbsp black olives, stones removed




Method


Heat the oil in a pan and sauté the onion for 3-4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for a further minute.


Add the wine and simmer for 2-3 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half.


Add the rice and stir well. Gradually add the stock a little at a time, stirring between each addition until all the liquid has been absorbed.


Add the edamame beans, butter, cheese, sun-blushed tomatoes and olives and stir well. Heat gently until the cheese has melted and the beans are tender.


To serve, place the risotto into a bowl and sprinkle with the remaining Manchego cheese.
