Ingredients

200ml/7fl oz Calvados
40g/1½oz demerara sugar
2 duck breasts

For the cabbage

3oz/85g butter
1 clove garlic
1 small onion
1 pack streaky bacon
½ Savoy cabbage, shredded finely




Method


Melt the sugar with the Calvados on a low heat until sugar is dissolved and the mixture starts to thicken slightly.


Allow to cool.


Soak the duck breasts in the Calvados glaze on all sides, then transfer to a baking tray and bake for 15 minutes at 180C/350/Gas 4.


For the cabbage, melt the butter on a low heat, then fry off the garlic, onion, and bacon. When the onions have softened, add the cabbage and sweat on a low heat for about 30 minutes.


Allow the duck to rest for a few minutes before serving alongside the cabbage.
