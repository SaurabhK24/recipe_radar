Switching to wholegrain flours will add a nutty flavour to your pancake proceedings - as well as fibre and slow-release energy.



Ingredients

275ml/9½fl oz skimmed milk
1 free-range egg
pinch salt
1 tsp vegetable oil
55g/2oz wholemeal flour
55g/2oz buckwheat flour
1 tsp vegetable oil, for cooking
1 lemon, juice only
1 orange, juice only




Method


Place the milk, egg, salt and oil into a large bowl and mix well.


Sift the wholewheat and buckwheat flour into a separate bowl.


Add the mixed flour to the milk mixture gradually, stirring constantly until a smooth batter is formed. Allow the batter to rest for thirty minutes prior to cooking.


Add teaspoon of oil to a hot pan, pour in an eighth of the mixture and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until golden on each side. Remove from the pan and place between sheets of baking paper and keep warm while repeating the process with the remaining mixture to create eight pancakes.


To serve, place a pancake onto a warmed plate and add a squeeze of fresh lemon and orange juice.




Recipe Tips
For perfect pancakes, make sure your batter is really thin. Wholegrain flour absorbs more liquid than white flour, so after resting, give it another beat and add a splash more milk if needed.
