Chocolate truffles seem so indulgent, but are simple to make. Try them with cinder toffee, also known as honeycomb toffee, for a truly sweet treat.

From James Martin: Home Comforts






Ingredients
For the chocolate truffles

350ml/12fl oz double cream
400g/14oz dark chocolate, about 60% cocoa solids, broken into pieces
3-4 tbsp sifted cocoa powder

For the cinder toffee

200g/7oz caster sugar
50ml/1¾fl oz clear honey
1 tbsp liquid glucose
¾ tsp bicarbonate of soda




Method


For the chocolate truffles, place the cream into a saucepan and bring to the boil.


Put the chocolate into a bowl, then when the cream is boiling pour it over the chocolate and mix well until the mixture is smooth.


Set aside to cool, then cover and place into the fridge to chill and become firm for about two hours.


Sift the cocoa powder onto a plate and, using a teaspoon, curl balls of chocolate and drop straight into the cocoa and then roll to coat them


Place on a plate to firm up, then serve, or keep in a sealed container in the fridge until ready to serve.


For the cinder toffee, line a baking tray with baking parchment.


Place the sugar, honey, glucose and 50ml/1¾fl oz of water into a saucepan and bring to a boil.


Continue to cook until the temperature reaches 160C/320F on a sugar thermometer.


Remove from the heat, allow to cool for 30 seconds so that the bubbles disperse, then quickly beat in the bicarbonate of soda, stirring constantly.


Pour onto the lined baking tray and leave to cool for 30 minutes.


Break into shards and store in a sealed container until you want to serve it.
