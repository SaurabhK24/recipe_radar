Ingredients

2 sausages
2 tsp vegetable oil
55g/2oz mature cheddar, in chunks
2 slices of back bacon, stretched with the back of a knife




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the sausages and cook them for about 5 minutes, so that all the sides are brown and cooked through.


Remove from the sausages from the pan and cool. Once cool enough to handle make slits lengthways down each sausage.


Stuff the cheese inside the slits, then wrap up with the bacon.


Place in the oven for 5-10 minutes, or until the bacon is nice and crispy and the sausages are cooked through.


Remove from the oven and serve on a warm plate.
