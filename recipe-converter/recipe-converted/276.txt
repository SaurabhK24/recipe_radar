Lemongrass, ginger and chillies add a wonderfully intense flavour and fragrance to roast chicken in this stunningly simple recipe.






By Nigel Slater


From Nigel and Adam's Farm Kitchen






Ingredients

2 sticks lemongrass
50g/1¾oz ginger, peeled
3 spring onions
2 medium red chillies
2 medium yellow chillies
1 medium green chilli
1 tbsp ground turmeric
200ml/7oz groundnut oil
1 whole chicken




Method


Set the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Combine all of the ingredients apart from the chicken in a food processor and blend until smooth.


Brush the chicken generously with the spice mix.


Cover the chicken with foil and roast in the oven for 70-80 minutes, or until the juices run clear when the chicken is pierced with a skewer – the cooking time will depend on the size of the chicken. Remove the foil half way through to allow the skin to crisp up.


Leave to rest for 15 minutes covered in foil before serving.
