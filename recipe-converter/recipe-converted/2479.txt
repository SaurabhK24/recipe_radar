Ingredients

225g/8oz self-raising flour
100g/3½oz dark chocolate
180g/6oz cooked, peeled chestnuts
30g/1oz cocoa
225g/8oz butter

Method


Roughly chop the chestnuts.


Gently melt the butter with the dark chocolate. Stir in the flour, chestnuts, cocoa, sugar, eggs and vanilla essence.


Turn into a lightly greased 1.2L/2pt pudding basin. Cover with a circle of baking parchment and foil. Secure the top with string and make a string handle from one side of the basin to another.


Steam for 2½ hours. Insert a skewer into the pudding to make sure it is cooked. Turn out of the dish and serve with cream or vanilla ice cream.
