Ingredients
For the crumble filling

55g/2oz butter
1 stick rhubarb, sliced
½ Bramley apple, chopped
1 tsp grated fresh ginger
1 tsp cornflour

For the crumble top

70g/2½oz butter
70g/2½oz caster sugar
70g/2½oz soft brown sugar
70g/2½oz plain flour
2 tbsp porridge oats

For the custard

150ml/¼ pint double cream
150ml/¼ pint coconut milk
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 free-range egg yolks
1 tbsp caster sugar




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the crumble filling, melt the butter in a small saucepan, add the rhubarb, apple and ginger and cook for three minutes, or until softened. Stir in the cornflour and cook for one minute. Spoon into a small ovenproof dish.


For the topping, place the butter, sugars and flour into a blender and process until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Stir in the porridge oats and then scatter over the fruit in the dish. Place on a baking tray and bake in the oven for ten minutes, or until the top is golden-brown.


For the custard, place the double cream, coconut milk and vanilla extract into a saucepan and bring almost to the boil.


In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until pale and frothy. Whisking continuously, pour the hot cream mix onto the egg mix and beat well. Pour back into the saucepan and stir until thickened slightly.


Serve the coconut custard with the crumble.
