Ingredients
For the Madeira cake

450g/1lb self-raising flour
60g/2¼oz desiccated coconut
400g/14oz caster sugar
400g/14oz margarine, plus extra for greasing
7 free-range eggs
50ml/2fl oz milk

For the buttercream

200g/7oz butter, softened
400g/14oz icing sugar, sifted
2-3 tbsp coconut-flavoured rum, such as Malibu




Method


Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.


For the Madeira cake, grease and line a 20cm/8in square or 23cm/9in round cake tin with margarine and greaseproof paper.


Place the all the cake ingredients into large bowl. Using an electric hand-mixer, bring all the ingredients together on the slowest setting.


Once the ingredients are combined, increase the speed and mix for one minute.


Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and smooth the top to make it level.


Bake in the middle of the oven for one hour 45 minutes to two hours. The cake should be springy to touch and golden-brown in colour.


Leave to cool in the tin for five minutes, remove and transfer to a wire rack.


For the buttercream, beat the butter in a bowl until soft. Gradually add the icing sugar and mix until incorporated. Stir in the coconut-flavoured rum.


Slice the cooled cake horizontally to create three layers. Sandwich these together with the buttercream. Serve in slices.
