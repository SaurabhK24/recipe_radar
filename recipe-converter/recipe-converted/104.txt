Ingredients

1 tbsp butter and a splash of olive oil
200-300g/7-10oz shallots
1 tsp honey or a heaped tsp of sugar
water




Method


Blanch the shallots in boiling water for a couple of minutes. This makes removing the skins easier.


Melt the butter with the oil in a frying pan and add the peeled shallots. Fry for a minute and then sprinkle with sugar or add the honey and coat the shallots. Take care that the shallots don t start to burn.


Season well and then pour over enough cold water to cover. Bring to the boil and cook on a medium heat until all the liquid is reduced and the shallots are softened and caramelised.
