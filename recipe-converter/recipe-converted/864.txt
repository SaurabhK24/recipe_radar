Veggie black pudding is worth seeking out for a really special breakfast treat. Combine with hard boiled eggs and savoury rice.

From Something for the Weekend






Ingredients

50g/2oz unsalted butter
1 onion, finely chopped
175g/6oz Arborio rice, or similar risotto rice
750ml/1¼pint hot vegetable stock
1 tsp curry powder
2 free-range eggs, hard boiled, chopped
150g/5oz vegetarian black pudding, sliced into rounds and fried until crisp (available online)
175g/6oz Puy lentils, washed, cooked according to packet instructions
1 handful fresh coriander leaves, chopped
1 tbsp desiccated coconut
pinch freshly ground nutmeg




Method


Melt the butter in a pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and fry until soft.


Add the rice and stir until the rice becomes translucent.


Add a large ladleful of stock and stir well. When the stock has absorbed, add another ladleful of stock. Repeat until the stock is all absorbed and the rice is just cooked through.


Add the curry powder and stir well.


Add the hard boiled eggs, fried black pudding, cooked lentils, coriander and coconut and gently stir until combined and warmed through.


To serve, spoon equal portions of the kedgeree into bowls and top with a little freshly grated nutmeg.
