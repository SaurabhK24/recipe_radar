Ingredients
For the veal schnitzel

1 slice white bread
1 tbsp chopped fresh basil
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives
1 tbsp chopped fresh chervil
1 garlic clove, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
100g/3½ oz veal
2 tbsp plain flour
2 free-range eggs, beaten
25g/1oz butter

For the apple and tomato ragu

1 tbsp olive oil
1 dessert apple, peeled, cored and chopped
55g/2oz cherry tomatoes, quartered
½ red onion, sliced
2 tbsp brown sugar
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar




Method


For the veal, place the bread, herbs, garlic, salt and freshly ground black pepper into a food processor and pulse to crumbs. Tip out onto a baking sheet.


Dust the veal in the flour, then dip in the beaten egg and coat in the breadcrumbs. Heat the butter in an ovenproof frying pan until frothing, then fry the veal for 2-3 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown. Transfer to the oven to cook for a further 5-6 minutes, or until crisp and cooked through.


For the ragu, place all of the ragu ingredients in a small pan and cook down for 6-8 minutes, or until the apples are tender.


Spoon the ragu onto a serving plate and place the schnitzel on top.
