Ingredients
For the rice pudding

200ml/7fl oz water
100g/3½oz caster sugar
100g/3½oz jasmine rice (Thai rice)
1cm/½in root ginger, peeled and finely chopped
1 orange, zest only
1 stalk lemongrass, lightly crushed
4 tbsp double cream

For the caramelised mango

½ mango, peeled and halved
2 tbsp icing sugar




Method


For the rice pudding, place the water into a saucepan, add the sugar and bring slowly to the boil.


Add the rice, ginger, orange zest and lemongrass and bring back to the boil.


Stir in the cream, reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10-12 minutes, or until the rice is tender.


Meanwhile, for the caramelised mango, preheat the grill to medium. Dust the mango pieces generously with the icing sugar and place under the grill. Cook until warmed through and caramelised.


To serve, place the rice pudding into serving bowls and top with the caramelised mango.
