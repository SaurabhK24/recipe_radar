Ingredients
For the chilli rice

150g/5oz basmati rice
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 fresh red chilli, finely chopped
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
1 tbsp soy sauce

For the sea bass

1 sea bass fillet
1 tbsp olive oil
Â¼ tsp cayenne pepper
1 tbsp soy sauce

For the herb dressing

1 tbsp finely chopped fresh chives
1 tbsp finely chopped fresh basil
3 tbsp olive oil




Method


Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.


For the chilli rice, cook the rice in boiling salted water, according to packet instructions. Drain.


Heat the oil in a frying pan, add the chilli and cook for one minute. Add the rice, parsley and soy sauce and cook for a further minute, then remove from the heat and set aside.


For the sea bass, place the fillet onto a non-stick baking sheet. Drizzle over the olive oil and season with the cayenne pepper and soy sauce. Place in the oven to bake for 7-8 minutes, or until the fish is completely cooked though.


For the dressing, mix the herbs and oil together in a small bowl.


To serve, spoon the chilli rice onto a plate. Place the sea bass on top and drizzle over the dressing.
