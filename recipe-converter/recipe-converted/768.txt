Ingredients
For the pastry

50g/2oz golden caster sugar
75g/3oz ground almonds
150g/5oz plain flour, sifted
110 g/4oz butter, diced
1 large free-range egg

For the filling

1 heaped tbsp semolina
750g/1lb 10oz brambles/blackberries
250g/9oz dulce de leche (Argentinean caramel spread) or canned caramel

For the crumble

75g/3oz plain flour, sifted
50g/2oz medium oatmeal
75g/3oz golden granulated sugar
75g/3oz butter, diced

For the Drambuie Brambles

450g/1lb brambles/blackberries
good slug of Drambuie
sugar to taste




Method


Make the pastry in the usual way: either by hand or in a food processor by processing the sugar, almonds, flour and butter together then adding the egg.


Once amalgamated, combine in your hands, wrap in clingfilm and chill well. (The pastry is softish.) Then roll out to fit a deep 23cm/9" loose-bottom, buttered flan tin. Prick the base and chill again - for at least 3 hours - preferably overnight.


Sprinkle the semolina over the pastry then scatter over the brambles. Warm the dulce de leche or caramel and spoon over the berries.


Make the crumble topping by mixing the flour, oatmeal and sugar and rub in the butter. Sprinkle over the berries and press down very lightly. Bake at 200C/400F/Gas 6 for 15 minutes then reduce to 180C/350F/Gas 4 for 25 minutes until golden brown. Leave until barely warm before carefully decanting to a plate.


Poach the brambles in the Drambuie, adding sugar to taste. Poach very briefly, only 3-5 minutes, so the berries are still firm. Serve warm - not hot - with the tart and some thick cream.
