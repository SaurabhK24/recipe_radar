Cheesecake and brownies: the ultimate sweet combination.






By Simon Rimmer


From Something for the Weekend






Ingredients
For the brownies

225g/8oz dark chocolate (minimum 70% cocoa solids)
150g/5½oz unsalted butter
3 free-range eggs
225g/8oz caster sugar
100ml/3½fl oz strong espresso
100g/3½oz plain flour

For the cheesecake

150g/5½oz full fat cream cheese
50g/1¾oz caster sugar
1 free-range egg
½ orange, zest only




Method


Preheat the oven to 170C/325F/Gas 3. Grease and line a 8in/20cm square cake tin.


For the brownies, melt the chocolate and butter in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water. (Do not let the base of the bowl touch the water.) Remove the bowl from the pan and set aside to cool slightly.


Whisk the eggs, caster sugar and coffee in a bowl until well combined. Sift in the flour and chocolate mixture and mix until well combined.


For the cheesecake, beat the cream cheese, caster sugar, egg and orange zest until smooth.


Spoon the brownie mixture into the cake tin then spoon the cheesecake mixture on top and use a knife to cut lines into the mixture to create a marble effect.


Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until just set. Remove the tin from the oven, set aside to cool completely, then cut into squares
