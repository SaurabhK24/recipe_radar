Little lemon tarts are great to make with kids and take no time at all. You can use jam instead of lemon curd for a change.



Ingredients

125g/4½oz shortcrust pastry
4 rounded tsp lemon curd
30g/1oz butter
2 tbsp rolled oats
2 dessertspoons caster sugar
2 tbsp self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting




Method


Wash your hands and put on an apron. Weigh and measure all the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 5.


Roll out the pastry onto a lightly floured surface and cut out four circles using a 8cm/3¼ in cutter. Line four holes in a muffin tin with the pastry circles.


Spoon the lemon curd into the pastry cases.


Melt the butter in a small saucepan and leave it to cool a little. Next add the oats, sugar and flour to the butter and mix with a fork, breaking it up into crumbs.


Sprinkle the crumbs onto the top of the tarts. Place the muffin tin onto a baking tray and bake for 15-20 minutes. Serve with fresh raspberries or strawberries.
