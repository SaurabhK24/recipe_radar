In a food processor blend together the coriander leaves and stalks, mint leaves, salt, garlic and chillies to make a rough paste. Add the lime juice, caster sugar, ginger and fish sauce and process until fairly smooth.


Spoon the sauce into a heat-proof bowl and combine with the salmon, then marinate for 20 minutes.


Boil some water in the bottom half of a steamer.


Place the bowl with the marinated salmon on top and steam for 6-8 minutes.


Blanch the pak choi and rice noodles for 1-2 minutes in boiling salted water, then drain and place in bowl.


Add the garlic, soy sauce, honey, ginger and chicken stock and toss to combine.
