Ingredients

55g/2oz breadcrumbs
55g/2oz flaked almonds
2 tbsp plain flour, mixed with a pinch of salt
1 free-range egg, beaten with 1 tbsp water
1 lemon sole fillet, skin removed
1 tbsp olive oil
15g/Â½oz butter

To serve

lemon wedges
tomato ketchup




Method


Blend the breadcrumbs and almonds in a food processor until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Sprinkle the mixture onto a plate.


Sprinkle the flour onto a separate plate. Pour the beaten egg into a bowl. Dredge the fish first in the flour, then dip it into the beaten egg and water, and finally roll it in the breadcrumb and almond mixture.


Heat the oil and butter in a frying pan over a medium heat and fry the coated fish for 4-6 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp on both sides and cooked through.


Serve the lemon sole with lemon wedges and tomato ketchup.
