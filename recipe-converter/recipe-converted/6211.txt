Ingredients
For the filling

2 tsp caster sugar
100g/3½oz mascarpone
100g/3½oz dark chocolate, chopped
1 red chilli, chopped

For the turnovers

1 large sheet ready-rolled puff pastry
1 free-range egg, beaten
2 tbsp caster sugar
1 tbsp icing sugar, for dusting

For the raspberry sauce

75g/2½oz raspberries
2 tbsp caster sugar
squeeze lemon juice
2 tbsp sparkling water




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


For the filling, place all of the filling ingredients into a bowl and mix well.


For the turnovers, cut the puff pastry into four squares and brush with the beaten egg.


Place a tablespoon of the filling mixture onto each square, then fold on the diagonal to make a triangle shape. Pinch to seal the edges and brush with a little more beaten egg.


Sprinkle the turnovers with caster sugar and place onto a baking sheet. Transfer to the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until puffed up and golden-brown.


For the raspberry sauce, place the raspberries, sugar, lemon juice and water into a mini food processor and blend until smooth.


To serve, place the turnovers onto plates with the raspberry sauce in a small bowl alongside and dust with icing sugar.
