Ingredients
For the pastry

85g/3oz butter
85g/3oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting
1 free-range egg, beaten

For the filling

30g/1oz butter
3 tbsp honey
3 apricots, halved, stones removed
1 vanilla pod, split, seeds scraped out
100ml/3½fl oz double cream, whipped, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the pastry, place the butter and flour into food processor and pulse until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the egg and blend until it comes together as a ball of pastry.


Turn out onto a floured surface, knead for one minute and then roll to the thickness of a pound coin. Cut to the size of an ovenproof medium-sized frying pan and set aside.


For the filling, heat the butter and honey in the frying pan, add the apricots, cut-side down, and the vanilla seeds and sauté for 2-3 minutes.


Turn over the apricots, cover with the prepared pastry and press down the edges to seal the pastry round the apricots. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes.


Remove from the oven, place a serving plate over the top of the frying pan, and flip the pan to turn out the tatin, fruit-side up.


To serve, cut into slices and top with lashings of whipped cream.
