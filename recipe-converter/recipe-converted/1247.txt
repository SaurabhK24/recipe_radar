Quintessentially British, what Christmas dinner would be complete without bread sauce to accompany the turkey?






By Marcus Wareing


From Great British Menu






Ingredients

550ml/1 pint whole milk
½ white onion, cut into quarters and studded with 3 cloves
2 fresh bay leaves
150g/5¼oz sliced white bread, cut into 3cm/1in squares
1 tsp English mustard
freshly grated nutmeg
50g/1¾oz unsalted butter, diced
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Heat the milk in a pan with the studded onion and bay leaves. Bring to the boil briefly then turn down to a gentle simmer.


Add the cubes of bread and stir until it starts to break down. Remove the onion and bay leaves and whisk in the mustard and a little freshly grated nutmeg to taste.


Cook slowly for 10 minutes, stirring regularly.


To finish, stir in the butter, season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Place in a bowl or gravy boat, cover with cling film and leave in a warm place until ready to serve.
