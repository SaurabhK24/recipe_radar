Ingredients

1 small Savoy cabbage, finely shredded
2 tbsp groundnut or corn oil
¼ tsp black mustard seeds
pinch fenugreek seeds
12 fresh curry leaves
1 dried red chilli, broken, seeds removed
2 small onions, sliced
2cm/¾in fresh ginger, finely shredded
¾ tsp turmeric powder
pinch chilli powder
1 tomato, diced




Method


Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Toss in the fenugreek and mustard seeds, curry leaves and the chilli. Lower the heat immediately and add the onions and ginger.


Cover the pan and soften the onions without browning for five minutes. Stir in the turmeric and chilli powder, then add the shredded cabbage and salt.


Cover the pan once more and cook over a gentle heat for about 10 minutes or until the cabbage has softened but retains a bite. Stir in the diced tomato and serve.
