A classic dish that uses beer instead of wine as a flavour - a great variation.

Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
1-2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped
1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed
1kg/2Â¼lb mussels, cleaned and de-bearded (broken or opened ones discarded)
1 bottle beer
2-3 tbsp finely chopped, parsley for garnish




Method


Heat a large, lidded saucepan and add the olive oil.


Add the shallots and garlic and cook for one minute.


Add the mussels and pour in the beer. Mix through, turn up the heat and put the lid on.


Cook, shaking the pan every now and again until all the mussels have opened and are cooked. Remove any mussels that remain closed.


Spoon into serving bowls with the juices, sprinkle with parsley and serve with rustic bread.
