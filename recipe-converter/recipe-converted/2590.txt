Ingredients
For the chocolate soufflé

3 free-range eggs, separated
50g/1¾oz caster sugar
2 tbsp cocoa powder
200g/7oz plain chocolate, melted
butter, for greasing

For the mango sauce

100g/3½oz mango, diced
1 tbsp icing sugar




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Place a baking sheet in the oven to heat.


To make the soufflé place the egg whites into a bowl and whisk until stiff.


Gradually add the caster sugar and continue to whisk until glossy stiff peaks are formed when the whisk is removed.


Place the cocoa powder and egg yolks into a bowl with the melted chocolate and mix together well.


Add a little of the egg white mixture to the chocolate mixture and mix together well.


Add the rest of the soufflé mixture to the chocolate mixture and fold in, taking care to maintain volume.


Grease a deep oven proof dish with the butter. Spoon in the meringue mix and place on the hot tray in the oven to bake for ten minutes, or until risen and cooked through.


To make the mango sauce, place the mango and icing sugar into a food processor and blend to a smooth purée.


Serve the soufflé fresh from the oven in its dish with the mango sauce in a bowl alongside.
