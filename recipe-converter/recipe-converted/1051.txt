Ingredients

125g/4½oz spinach
100g/3½oz goats' cheese
2 tsp crushed black peppercorns
2 tbsp pine nuts, toasted

For the dressing

55g/2oz raspberries
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
3 tbsp olive oil




Method


Preheat the grill to medium.


Place the spinach into a warm frying pan and stir over a low heat until wilted. Drain off the excess water and then pile onto a serving plate.


Cut the goats' cheese in half through the middle. Roll each circle of cheese in the crushed black pepper.


Place the goats' cheese onto a sheet of foil on a baking sheet. Place under the grill for 3-4 minutes, or until just beginning to melt.


Place the warm goats' cheese on top of the spinach and scatter over the toasted pine nuts.


For the dressing, place the raspberries, balsamic vinegar and olive oil into a mini food processor and blend until smooth.


Pour the dressing over the goats' cheese and serve.
