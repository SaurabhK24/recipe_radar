Ingredients
For the chicken

1 tbsp olive oil
½ chicken breast fillet, sliced into strips
50ml/2fl oz white wine

For the sauce

100ml/3½fl oz double cream
55g/2oz Dolcelatte cheese
15g/½oz butter
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley

For the pea and potato purée

1 Desirée potato, peeled and chopped
55g/2oz peas
2 tbsp olive oil
6 fresh mint leaves, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the chicken, heat the olive oil in a pan and fry the strips of chicken for 3-5 minutes, or until golden-brown and just cooked through.


Add the wine to the pan to deglaze, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 2-3 more minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half in volume.


For the sauce, add the cream and cheese to the pan with the chicken and bring to a simmer, stirring until the cheese has melted. Finally, stir in the butter and parsley.


For the pea and potato purée, cook the potato in a pan of boiling water for 7-9 minutes, or until tender, adding the peas for the last 2-3 minutes of cooking time. Drain and place the peas and potato into a food processor with the olive oil and mint. Blend to a smooth purée, then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, spoon the pea and potato purée onto a serving plate and place the chicken strips on top. Drizzle the cream sauce around the edges of the plate.
