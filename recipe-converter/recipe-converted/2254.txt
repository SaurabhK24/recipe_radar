Ingredients

4 skinless chicken breasts (without wing bone)
4 tsp cream
190ml/¼ pint crème fraîche
190ml/¼ pint strong chicken stock
9oz/250g shallots, quartered and then pan-fried in a little butter
2 leeks, chopped, washed and then pan-fried in a little butter
salt and pepper
1 packet of ready-made puff pastry (pre-rolled if possible)




Method


Heat an oiled char-griller or heat a little oil in a pan. Seal the chicken on both sides.


Heat the cream, crème fraîche and stock together.


Cut the chicken into fork-sized pieces and place in the hot sauce. After 5 minutes, add the shallots and leeks and heat for a further 5 minutes. Season.


Meanwhile, make 4-6 small circles using the pre-rolled puff pastry. Place on a baking sheet and bake until risen.


Serve the chicken and leeks with a circle of pastry on top.
