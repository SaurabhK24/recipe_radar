Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
½ onion, sliced
150g/5½ oz chorizo, chopped
small handful parsley, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 slices ciabatta
1 tbsp olive oil
2 free-range eggs, fried




Method


Heat the oil in a small frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and chorizo and fry for four minutes, until the juices start to run from the chorizo. Stir in the parsley and season with freshly ground black pepper.


Heat a griddle pan over a high heat. Drizzle the ciabatta with the olive oil and griddle on both sides for two minutes or until golden.


To serve, place the griddled ciabatta on to a serving plate. Place the chorizo and onion onto top, and then top with the fried eggs.
