Ingredients

1 potato, cut into small cubes
handful spinach
55g/2oz cheddar cheese, grated
knob of butter
1 tbsp fresh horseradish, grated
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat oven to 225C/450F/Gas 7.


Boil the potato in salted water for 5-10 minutes until soft, then drain.


Steam the spinach for two minutes, then drain on kitchen paper.


Grease the inside of a dariole mould with oil.


Layer the spinach around the inside of the mould, so that the leaves hang over the edge.


Mash the potato with the cheese, butter and horseradish and season to taste, with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Fill the mould with the potato mixture and fold over the excess hanging spinach leaves and place in the oven to bake for ten minutes.


To serve, carefully turn out the pudding onto a warm plate and remove the dariole mould.
