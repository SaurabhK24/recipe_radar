Ingredients
For the carpaccio

150g/5½oz good-quality rib-eye steak
3 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
½ tsp dried chilli flakes
salt and freshly ground black pepper

To garnish

1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
25g/1oz fresh broad beans, podded, blanched
½ lime, juice only




Method


For the carpaccio, begin by placing the steak between two sheets of silicone paper and flattening it out with a meat mallet or rolling pin. Place the beef onto a baking tray and place in the freezer to firm up but not freeze completely, about 20-30 minutes.


In a bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar and chilli flakes and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, remove the steak from the freezer and slice thinly with a very sharp knife. Arrange the slices on a plate, drizzle over the chilli dressing and garnish with coriander, broad beans and a squeeze of lime juice.
