Ingredients

900g/2lb small heritage beetroot, trimmed
3 tbsp rapeseed oil
900g/2lb boar fillet
salt and freshly ground black pepper
55g/2oz butter
1 tbsp cumin seeds
2 tbsp chopped chives




Method


Cook the beetroot in boiling salted water for about 30 minutes (depending on size) until just cooked. Remove from the water and leave to cool.


In another pan, heat two tablespoons of oil and fry the boar fillets for about 10 minutes, turning frequently.


Season with salt and pepper, then take out and leave to rest for 10 minutes. Reserve the pan juices.


While the meat is resting, slip the skins off the beetroot and cut them into wedges.


Heat the remaining oil and the butter in a frying pan and add the beetroot wedges. Fry for about five minutes then season with salt and pepper and add the cumin seeds. Stir, then take off the heat.


To serve, lay the beetroot on a serving dish. Slice the boar fillets and arrange the meat on top of the beetroot. Pour over the pan juices and sprinkle with chopped chives.
