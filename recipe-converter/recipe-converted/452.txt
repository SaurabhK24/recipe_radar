Ingredients

½ block of firm tofu, drained
¼ tsp dried chilli flakes
pinch salt
1 small bunch fresh thyme, leaves picked
2 sheets of ready-made filo pastry, cut to 15cm/6in squares
1 free-range egg, beaten
1 tsp sesame seeds
olive oil, to drizzle




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Place the dried chilli flakes, salt and thyme into a bowl. Add the tofu and toss to coat evenly.


Brush the two sheets of filo pastry with the beaten egg.


Divide the tofu between the two sheets, placing it into the centre of each sheet, then fold in the edges of the filo on all sides to create two parcels.


Brush all over with egg and sprinkle with sesame seeds, then place on a baking sheet and place into the oven to bake for five minutes, or until golden.


Remove and place onto a warmed plate and drizzle with olive oil to serve.
