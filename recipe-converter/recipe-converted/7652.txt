Ingredients
For the cake

200g/7oz canned pineapple rings
115g/4oz butter, softened
115g/4oz caster sugar
2 free-range eggs
115g/4oz self-raising flour

For the honey and lime syrup

½ tsp dried chilli flakes
3 tbsp pineapple juice (from the can of pineapples)
3 tbsp honey
½ lime, juice only




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the cake, line an 18cm/7in square baking tin with parchment paper and lay the pineapple rings over the base of the tin.


Place the butter and sugar into a food processor and process until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time and beat well between each addition. Beat in the flour.


Spoon the cake mixture over the pineapple rings and smooth the surface flat. Place in the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until golden-brown and springy to the touch. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly, then remove the baking parchment and cut into large slices.


For the syrup, place the chilli flakes, pineapple juice, honey and lime juice into a small pan and simmer for six minutes, or until syrupy.


To serve, place the cake slices onto a serving plate and pour over the syrup.
