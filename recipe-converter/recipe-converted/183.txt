Ingredients

1 onion, sliced as thinly as possible
1 medium potato, peeled and grated
1 medium carrot, peeled and grated
1 large banana grated (a plantain is best for this)
2 hot green chillies, finely chopped
½ tsp ground, dried red chilli
2 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped
½ tsp lemon juice
1 tsp cumin seeds, crushed
2tsp coriander seeds, crushed
½ tsp ajowan (carom seeds), crushed (also known as lovage )
6-7 tbsp besan (chickpea flour)
½ tsp salt or to taste
oil for deep frying
2 tbsp water

Tip For the best results gently roast the cumin, ajowan and coriander seeds in a pan until they change colour but do not burn, and then cool and crush them. The spices will now have a better flavour and aroma.

Method


Put the onion, potato, carrot and banana in a large bowl and add the green chillies, ground chilli, fresh coriander, lemon juice, cumin and ajowan. Sift the chickpea flour with the salt into a bowl.


Heat plenty of oil in a deep pan but do not let it get too hot.


Gradually add the sifted flour to the onion mixture, rubbing it in with your fingers until firm and sticky. Add the water and mix well.


With your fingers, put small dollops (no bigger than 2.5cm/1in) of the mixture into the oil to fry, just a few at a time or they will be soggy.


Fry them slowly until crisp and golden on the outside and cooked through in the centre - about 3-4 minutes. If the oil is too hot they will be raw and gooey inside.


Drain in a sieve placed over a bowl and then serve immediately with Green Coconut Chutney (see separate recipe).
