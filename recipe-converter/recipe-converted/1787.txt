Ingredients
For the chargrilled lamb

2 tbsp chopped fresh rosemary leaves
½ tsp black peppercorns, cracked
100g/3½oz lamb leg steak
pinch salt
1 tbsp olive oil

For the feta and green bean salad

85g/3oz green beans, trimmed and blanched
¼ onion, peeled, finely sliced
½ lemon, juice only
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
55g/2oz feta, crumbled
2 tbsp pistachio nuts




Method


For the chargrilled lamb, heat a griddle pan until hot. Rub the rosemary and black pepper into both sides of the lamb leg steak, season with the salt and drizzle over the olive oil.


Cook the lamb on the griddle over a medium heat for 4-5 minutes on each side (for medium), or until golden-brown all over and cooked to your liking. Remove the meat from the pan and leave to rest on a warm plate.


For the feta green bean salad, gently mix together all of the salad ingredients in a bowl.


To serve, spoon the feta and green bean salad onto a serving plate and place the lamb leg steak alongside.
