Ingredients
For the baked Vacherin Mont d'Or

350g/12oz Vacherin Mont d'Or (in a wooden box)
4 garlic cloves, sliced
1 sprig fresh rosemary, cut into short lengths
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the garlic bruschetta

6 slices baguette
2 tbsp olive oil
2 garlic cloves, peeled and halved




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the baked Vacherin Mont d'Or, remove the lid from the cheese box. Make several slits in the top of the cheese with a sharp knife and place the garlic slices and rosemary sprigs into the slits.


Drizzle with olive oil and season with a little salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Place on a baking sheet and place in the oven for 8-10 minutes, until melted.


For the garlic bruschetta, drizzle the slices of baguette with olive oil and rub with garlic.


Heat a griddle pan and griddle the bread for two minutes on each side, or until charred. Remove from the heat and cut into fingers.


To serve, place the cheese box onto a serving plate and dip the garlic bruschetta fingers into the molten cheese.
