Nigel Slater dresses leftover turkey up with a sweet-and-sour marinade and a zingy citrus salad.






By Nigel Slater


From Nigel Slater's Simple Suppers






Ingredients

4-6 good handfuls leftover roast turkey meat
3 garlic cloves
salt
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons soy sauce
a tablespoon chilli sauce
a tablespoon tomato ketchup
a tablespoon grain mustard
black pepper
groundnut oil

For the salad

2 oranges
a grapefruit
4 handfuls watercress




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Strip the cooked meat from the turkey, keeping the pieces as large as you can. They will stay juicier that way.


Peel the garlic and add to a pestle and mortar along with a generous pinch of salt. Grind to a paste and transfer to a bowl. Stir in the honey, soy sauce, chilli sauce, ketchup, mustard and a drizzle of groundnut oil. Season with a little black pepper, then add the turkey meat. Toss gently then tip everything into a baking dish. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the meat is glistening.


Meanwhile make the salad. Peel the oranges and grapefruit with a sharp knife, then slice thinly. Toss with the watercress.


To serve, pile the hot turkey onto the salad and serve.
