Ingredients
For the goats' cheese salad

100g/3½oz soft goats cheese, cut into rounds
1 tsp coarsely ground black pepper

For the balsamic blueberry sauce

1 tbsp olive oil
2 shallots, roughly chopped
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
75g/2¾oz blueberries
½ tsp freshly ground black pepper

For the mixed herb salad

100g/3½oz chopped mixed fresh herbs (flatleaf parsley, chervil, dill, coriander, basil, chives)




Method


For the goats' cheese salad, place a griddle pan over a high heat until it begins to smoke.


Roll the goats' cheese in the coarsely ground black pepper and place onto the griddle pan to cook for two minutes on each side.


To make the sauce, heat the olive oil in a small frying pan over a medium heat. Add the shallot and fry until soft.


Add the balsamic vinegar, blueberries and freshly ground black pepper, then bring to the boil and reduce the liquid volume by half.


To serve, place the mixed herb salad in the centre of the plate. Place the grilled goats' cheese on top and pour over the sauce.
