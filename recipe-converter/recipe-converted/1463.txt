Ingredients
For the tart

450g/1lb all-butter puff pastry
1 free-range egg yolk, beaten
300g/10½oz marzipan
4 dessert apples, peeled, cored and finely sliced
50g/1¾oz butter
4 tbsp clear honey
vanilla ice cream, to serve

For the spiced caramel sauce

150g/5½oz caster sugar
2 star anise
½ tsp cloves
¼ tsp freshly grated nutmeg
½ tsp juniper berries
175ml/6fl oz double cream




Method


Preheat the oven to 210C/425F/Gas 7.


On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the puff pastry to 3-4mm/⅛in thick. Cut out four 12cm/4½in circles using a pastry cutter and transfer to a baking tray.


Score a circle in the centre of the pastry with a knife (leaving a 1cm/½in border) then brush with egg wash.


Roll the marzipan out to 5mm/¼in thick and cut into four 11cm/4¼in circles and place in the centre of the pastry. Carefully place the apples in an overlapping ring over the marzipan to cover it all.


Place the butter and honey in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer, stirring to combine. Brush most of it over the top of the apples.


Place in the oven and bake for 15-18 minutes, or until the pastry is risen and golden-brown.


Brush with any remaining melted butter and honey to glaze.


For the spiced caramel sauce, place the sugar and spices in a frying pan and cook until the sugar is melted and golden-brown. Whisk in the double cream and bring to a simmer.


Cook for 3-5 minutes, or until just thickened, then pass through a fine sieve into a clean pan.


To serve, place the tarts in the centre of serving plates and spoon the sauce around the edge. Finish with a spoonful of ice cream on top.
