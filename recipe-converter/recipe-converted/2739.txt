Ingredients

115g/4oz Brussels sprouts
2 tbsp sunflower oil
1 onion, thinly sliced
2 turkey steaks, cut into strips
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
Â½ orange, juice only
2 tbsp dark soy sauce
1 tsp sesame seeds
handful chopped fresh mixed herbs (chives, parsley, coriander), to garnish




Method


Blanch the Brussels sprouts in a pan of boiling salted water for 2-3 minutes until just tender. Drain well and when cool enough to handle peel away the outer layers and trim the ends. Cut each Brussels sprout into quarters.


Heat a wok until smoking hot. Add the oil and the onion and stir fry for 1-2 minutes. Add the turkey and stir fry for 2-3 minutes until lightly browned.


Add the garlic and the blanched sprouts and stir fry for 1-2 minutes, until heated through.


Pour in the orange juice and soy sauce and mix together. Sprinkle over the seasme seeds and then transfer to a warm serving plate.


Garnish with the herbs and serve at once.
