Ingredients

4 haddock fillets, about 150g/5½ oz each
4 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
1 red chilli, chopped
1 shallot, thinly sliced
1 lime, sliced, plus extra lime halves to serve
2 lemongrass stalks, 1 roughly chopped and 1 bashed
300g/10½oz basmati rice
2 fresh or dried kaffir lime leaves
50ml/2fl oz reduced-fat coconut milk




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.


Cut 4 pieces of nonstick baking paper, each 30cm/12in square. Put a haddock fillet in the centre of each piece and arrange some of the coriander, chilli, shallot, lime and chopped lemongrass stalk evenly over each. Wrap them up into neat parcels. Transfer the parcels to a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes.


Put the rice in a lidded pan, cover with water and bring to the boil. Simmer with the lid on for 10 minutes, or until the rice is soft. When the rice is cooked and the water absorbed, stir in the coconut milk.


Serve with the rice alongside the haddock parcels, with some extra lime halves.
