Use a Japanese mandolin to get super skinny slices of vegetable for this alternative to normal crisps. A good snack to take to work.

Ingredients

1 parsnip
2 beetroot, look for yellow or orange varieties as well as purple
1 carrot
1 litre/1¾ pints vegetable oil
salt, to taste




Method


Slice the vegetables using a Japanese mandolin.


Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer or heavy-based saucepan to 180C/350F. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Add one type of sliced vegetables to the hot fat at a time and once browned and cooked through, remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper. Repeat with all three types of vegetable.


Sprinkle with salt to serve.
