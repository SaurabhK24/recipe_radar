A brilliant twist on classic potato rosti, this makes a great summery dish for an easy lunch or supper.

Ingredients
For the rosti

200g/7oz shelled fresh peas
350g/12oz courgettes, grated
150g/5½oz ground rice
3 tbsp shredded basil leaves, plus extra to serve
70g/2½oz parmesan (or a vegetarian alternative), grated
50g/1¾oz pine nuts, lightly toasted
2 free-range eggs, lightly beaten
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp olive oil

For the tangy tomato dressing

6 tbsp olive oil
1 ripe plum tomato, seeds removed and finely diced
4 sun-dried tomatoes in oil, drained and finely chopped
1 small shallot, finely chopped
1 tbsp red wine vinegar




Method


For the rosti, blanch the peas in a pan of boiling salted water for two minutes or until just tender then drain well. Refresh in a bowl of iced water and drain again.


Squeeze the courgettes in a clean tea towel and place in a large bowl. Mix in the blanched peas, ground rice, basil, parmesan and pine nuts then add the beaten eggs and season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Divide the mixture into 16 evenly sized balls and slightly flatten each one.


Heat one tablespoon of the olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and fry half the rosti for 2-3 minutes on each side or until crisp and golden-brown. Drain on kitchen paper and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining oil and rostis.


To make the dressing, place the ingredients in a bowl, mix until well combined and season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Place a stack of rosti on each plate, drizzle a little dressing over and around the rosti and garnish with a sprinkling of shredded basil leaves.
