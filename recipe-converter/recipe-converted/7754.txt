Ingredients
For the sweet plum tart

100g/3½oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting
1 tbsp icing sugar
55g/2oz butter
1 free-range egg, yolk only
½ orange, zest only
1 tbsp chopped fresh mint
1 plum, stone removed, sliced
25g/1oz butter, cut into small pieces
1 tbsp caster sugar

For the vanilla cream

150ml/5fl oz double cream, whipped until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed
1 tbsp icing sugar
1 vanilla pod, seeds only




Method


For the tart, blend the flour, icing sugar and butter in a food processor until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.


Add the egg yolk, orange zest and mint and blend again, adding cold watera tablespoon at a time, until the pastry just comes together.


Roll out the dough out onto a clean, lightly floured work surface until it is the size of the base of a small frying pan. Heat the pan over a medium heat and fry the pastry for 2-3 minutes on both sides, or until pale golden-brown.


Arrange the plum slices on top of the pastry circle. Scatter the butter pieces and caster sugar over the plum slices and continue to fry for 3-4 minutes until the heat melts the butter and the sugar is gooey.


For the vanilla cream, mix the cream with the icing sugar and vanilla seeds.


To serve, turn the sweet plum tart out onto a serving plate, and place a spoonful of the vanilla cream next to it.
