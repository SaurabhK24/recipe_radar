Ingredients
For the venison meat balls

150g/ 5½oz venison leg, boned
2 baby leeks, chopped
1 clove garlic, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp plain flour
1 tbsp vegetable oil

For the gravy

75ml/ 2½fl oz red wine
balsamic vinegar, for drizzling
50g/ 1¾oz butter

For the parsnip crisps

3 parsnips, peeled and sliced into long thin ribbons
vegetable oil, for deep frying
1 tbsp clear honey
1 lime, cut into wedges to garnish




Method


For the meatballs, place the venison, leeks, garlic, salt and freshly ground black pepper into a food processor and blend until combined.


Using floured hands, on a clean work surface, roll the minced meat into golf ball size balls. Heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan over a high heat and fry the meatballs for six minutes, or cooked all the way through. Remove the meatballs from the pan and keep warm.


For the gravy, add the red wine to the meatball pan, turn up the heat and loosen the bits in the pan with a spoon.


Turn the heat up, add the balsamic vinegar and cook over a high heat until the liquid reduces by half. Stir in the butter and cook for one minute. Keep warm.


For the parsnip crisps, heat the oil in a deep heavy-bottomed saucepan, until very hot or until a breadcrumb sizzles in it (CAUTION: Hot oil is very dangerous. Do not leave unattended).


Carefully lower the parsnips into the hot oil and deep fry for six minutes or until golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


Transfer the parsnips onto a serving plate and drizzle with the honey.


To serve, pile the meatballs on top of the parsnip crisps, pour over the gravy and garnish with the lime wedges.
