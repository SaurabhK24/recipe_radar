Ingredients
For the steak

125g/4oz rump steak
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the celeriac chips

½ celeriac, peeled and cut into chips
2 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 garlic cloves, crushed

For the roast button mushrooms

15g/½oz butter
5 chestnut mushrooms

For the jus

100ml/3½fl oz red wine




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the steak, brush the meat with the oil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a chargrill pan until smoking, then griddle the steak for 2-3 minutes on both sides (for rare), or until cooked to your liking. Remove from the pan and allow to rest on a warm plate.


For the celeriac chips, place the celeriac slices on a baking sheet and drizzle over the olive oil. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, scatter over the garlic cloves and roast in the oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the celeriac slices are golden-brown and crisp.


For the mushrooms, melt the butter in an ovenproof frying pan and fry the mushrooms, whole, for 2-3 minutes, or until lightly golden. Transfer to the oven to roast for 8-10 minutes, or until golden-brown all over.


For the jus, pour the wine into the steak pan to deglaze and reduce over a high heat for 3-4 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half.


Serve the steak with the celeriac chips and mushrooms on the side and spoon the jus around the edges of the plate.
