This is basically a posh cheese on toast - made with smoked fish, silky cream and parmesan. The fresh horseradish gives a lovely kick. Leave out or add a sprinkling of chillies instead – as always it’s up to you!

Ingredients

4 thickish slices bread
2 smoked mackerel fillets
5 tbsp double cream
60g/2¼oz parmesan
freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp chopped chives
fresh horseradish, to taste




Method


Have four slices of your favourite bread ready toasting under the grill.


Peel the skin off the mackerel and flake into a bowl. Add four tablespoons of double cream, grate in 50g/2oz of parmesan, add a pinch of black pepper and mix with a fork. Add a spoonful of chopped chives and some grated horseradish, and mix again.


Pile the mixture onto the toast. Add a final drizzle of cream and a scattering of grated parmesan and put them under the grill for 3-4 minutes. Serve when they start to bubble and brown.
