Ingredients
For the marinade

2 stalks lemongrass, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 shallots, finely chopped
1 chilli, finely chopped
2 tbsp Thai fish sauce (nam pla)
1 tbsp lime juice
1 tbsp water
1 tbsp sesame seed oil

For the beef

450g/1lb beef fillet
2 tbsp sesame seeds

For the dipping sauce

2 limes, juice only
2 tbsp Thai fish sauce (nam pla)
2 tbsp water
2 tbsp cider vinegar
1 tsp sugar
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 chilli, chopped
1 carrot, finely grated




Method


Mix all the marinade ingredients together in a large bowl.


Roll the beef tightly in cling film to form a round roll and leave to sit in the fridge for 30 minutes. Remove from the fridge when 'set' in a roll.


Unwrap the beef and slice into 5mm thick discs. Place the discs in the marinade and leave for 30 minutes.


Place the beef slices onto cocktail sticks, to resemble lollipops, and sprinkle with sesame seeds.


Heat a griddle pan. Add the beef discs and griddle for 1-2 minutes on each side, until sesame seeds have taken colour.


Meanwhile for the dipping sauce, mix all ingredients together in a bowl.


To serve, place the beef slices onto a serving plate with the bowl of dipping sauce alongside.
