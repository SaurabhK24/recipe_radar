The Charentais melon is juicy and sweet and perfect in this South Indian-inspired dessert. The melon leaks into the creamy coconut and is uplifted by the pomegranate seeds. A beautiful,
  refreshing dessert. Serve cold.

Ingredients

225g/8oz Charentais melon flesh, skin removed, chopped
225ml/8fl oz fresh or canned coconut milk
2 tbsp sugar, or to taste
1 pomegranate, fleshy seeds only

To serve

2 handfuls crushed ice
1 handful flaked almonds, lightly toasted in the oven until just golden




Method


Place the melon pieces into a deep bowl. Using your fingers, crush them so that they are no longer regular in shape and start to leak out their wonderful juice, but do not let them become mushy.


Add the coconut milk and sugar and mix well. The colour should be a beautiful pale peach.


Stir in the pomegranate seeds and chill in the fridge until ready to serve.


To serve, place a tablespoon of crushed ice in the bottom of each of six serving bowls and top with the rasayana. Sprinkle over the flaked almonds.
