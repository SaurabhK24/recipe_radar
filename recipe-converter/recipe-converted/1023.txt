Ingredients
For the croutons

25g/1oz unsalted butter
3 slices bread, crusts removed and cut into 1cm cubes
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil

For the salad

2 tsp butter
100g/3½oz spinach, washed
salt and freshly ground black pepper
75g/3oz Pecorino, chopped into 1cm cubes

For the pesto dressing

2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 large handfuls fresh basil leaves
50g/2oz Pecorino, grated
150ml/¼ pint olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the croutons, heat the butter in a frying pan. Add the bread cubes, salt and freshly ground black pepper and one tablespoon olive oil. Fry gently until golden brown on all sides. Remove from the heat and drain on kitchen paper.


For the salad, melt the butter in a large saucepan, add the spinach and toss to coat in the butter. Cook for 1-2 minutes, tossing frequently, until starting to wilt. Add the Pecorino cubes and remove from the heat.


For the pesto dressing, put all the ingredients in a food processor and blend until almost smooth.


To serve, place the spinach and Pecorino salad onto a large plate. Scatter with the croutons and drizzle with pesto dressing.
