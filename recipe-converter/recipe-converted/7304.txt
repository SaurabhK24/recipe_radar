This spicy, richly flavoured pasta dish is super quick to make. Use pancetta if you can’t find the cured pork cheeks.






By Antonio Carluccio and Gennaro Contaldo


From Two Greedy Italians






Ingredients

130g/5oz guanciale (cured pork cheeks), cut into small cubes
1 small onion, finely chopped
3-4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 hot dried red chilli, finely chopped
2 tbsp dry white wine
500g/1lb 2oz San Marzano tomatoes, cut into quarters
400g/14oz bucatini pasta
80g/3oz pecorino, freshly grated




Method


For the sauce, put the guanciale and onion in a pan with the oil and chilli, and fry gently for about 4-5 minutes. Add the white wine and tomatoes and cook for a further 15–20 minutes, stirring occasionally.


Meanwhile, bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to the boil, and cook the pasta until al dente. Strain the bucatini and mix with the sauce. Serve sprinkled generously with the freshly grated pecorino.




Recipe Tips
Bucatini is a large spaghetti-type pasta with a hole down the middle, which makes it easy to cook. You should use guanciale, cured pig cheek, although you could substitute the less tasty pancetta. Use pecorino cheese here rather than the posher (and dearer) Parmesan.
