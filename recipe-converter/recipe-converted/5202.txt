This is the simple, straight-forward, everyday pancake recipe, great for sweet or savoury pancakes.






By William Leigh






Ingredients

200g/7oz plain flour
350-400ml/12-14fl oz milk, or ½ milk ½ water for a lighter pancake
2 large eggs, lightly whisked
1 tbsp vegetable oil
pinch salt
vegetable oil, for frying




Method


Put the flour into a large bowl, make a well in the centre and pour in the milk and eggs. Give the liquid mixture a quick whisk before incorporating the flour. Continue to whisk until you have a smooth batter.


Now add 1 tbsp vegetable oil and whisk thoroughly.


Take a crêpe pan, or large frying pan, dip some kitchen roll in the oil and carefully wipe the inside of the pan. Heat the pan over a medium heat for a minute.


Add just under a ladleful of batter to the pan and immediately start swirling it round the pan to get a nice even layer.


Cook the pancake for approximately 30-40 seconds. Use a palette knife to lift the pancake carefully to look at the underside to check it is golden-brown before turning over. Cook the other side for approx 30-40 seconds and transfer to a serving plate.




Recipe Tips
The pancakes can be eaten straight away, or frozen after cooling - stack and wrap them in twos.

  You can use this batter to make sweet or savoury pancakes. For sweet pancakes you can add a desert spoon of caster sugar and the zest of an orange, this will give the pancakes a great flavour.
  For savoury pancakes you can add some finely chopped herbs such as dill and parsley, or perhaps some grated Parmesan cheese.
