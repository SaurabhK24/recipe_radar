Take care to squeeze out any excess water from the tofu to get the maximum flavour from the marinade.






By Nick Nairn


From Ready Steady Cook






Ingredients
For the marinated tofu

2 tbsp olive oil
½ lime, zest and juice
large pinch chilli flakes
2 tbsp soy sauce
2 tbsp honey
2 tbsp vegetable oil
150g/5½oz tofu, cut into pieces

For the stir fried rice

2 tbsp vegetable oil
¼ onion, finely sliced
1 garlic clove, crushed
¼ red pepper, chopped
handful spinach leaves
150g/5½oz basmati rice, cooked according to packet instructions and drained




Method


For the marinated tofu, combine all the marinade ingredients, except the vegetable oil, in a bowl and mix well. Add the tofu, coat in the mixture and allow to marinate for 5-10 minutes, or longer if possible.


Heat a wok over a medium heat. Remove the tofu from the marinade, setting the marinade aside. Fry the tofu for 5-10 minutes until golden-brown all over. Strain the marinade to remove any small pieces of tofu.


For the rice, heat the oil in a pan and fry the onions and garlic for 2-3 minutes until softened, then add the pepper and fry until the tofu for 2 minutes. Add the spinach, rice and reserved marinade and heat through for a further 3-4 minutes.


Serve the rice with the marinated tofu on top.
