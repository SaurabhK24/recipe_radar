Method


For the sponge, place the sugar, butter, flour, eggs, lemon, milk and vanilla into a food processor and blend until smooth.


Grease a pie dish with butter and line with the slices of lemons. Drizzle with honey and sprinkle with the pine nuts and pour over the sponge mixture.


Cover with cling film and place into the microwave and cook on high power for four minutes.


Turn the cake out onto a serving plate and dust with icing sugar and garnish with the mint.


For the cream, place the cream into a bowl and fold the honey through the cream. Spread on to the cake with a palette knife.


For the spun sugar, melt the sugar in a pan over a medium heat, until it turns to a dark, caramel colour. Take off the heat and dip an oiled spoon into the sugar and drizzle the sugar in a squiggly shape onto parchment paper. Allow to set.


To serve, stick the set sugar on to the cake.
