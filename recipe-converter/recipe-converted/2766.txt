Ingredients

oil, for greasing
200g/7oz butter
200g/7oz caster sugar
½ tsp vanilla essence
4 free-range eggs
200g/7oz self-raising flour, sifted
½ jar raspberry jam
175ml/6fl oz double cream, whipped
250g/9oz raspberries
2-3 tbsp icing sugar




Method


Preheat the oven to 190C/350F/Gas 5. Grease and line 2 x 20cm/8in sandwich tins.


Mix the butter, sugar and vanilla essence in a bowl or food processor until well combined.


Slowly beat in the eggs one by one. Fold in the sifted flour and carefully pour the mixture into the prepared tins.


Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden-brown. Test by pushing a skewer into the centre of the cake. If the skewer comes out clean the cake is ready.


Turn the cake out onto a wire rack and set aside to cool.


Spread one cake with the raspberry jam, followed by a layer of whipped cream. Cover with the raspberries and place the other cake on top.


To serve, dust with icing sugar and cut the cake into slices.
