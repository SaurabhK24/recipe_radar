Ingredients
For the butter bean cakes

1 tbsp olive oil
100g/3½oz can butter beans, rinsed and drained
¼ onion, roughly chopped
1 garlic clove
50g/1¾oz parmesan, or similar vegetarian hard cheese, grated
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the salad

1 tbsp olive oil
½tsp red wine vinegar
100g/3½oz spinach leaves
50g/1¾oz cherry tomatoes, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the butter bean cakes, place the olive oil, butter beans, onion, garlic and parmesan into a food processor and blend, until smooth. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Heat some oil in a frying pan and divide the mixture into four. Place into the pan and fry for two minutes on each side, or until golden and cooked through.


For the salad, whisk together the oil and vinegar in a clean bowl and add the spinach and tomatoes. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper, and mix well.


To serve, place the salad on a plate and top with the butter bean cakes.
