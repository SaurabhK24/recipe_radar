Ingredients
For the soup

2 tbsp olive oil
½ onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
½ leek, green part only, chopped
400ml/14fl oz vegetable stock
3 tbsp double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the croûtes

3 slices French stick
85g/3oz mature cheddar, grated
1 red chilli, de-seeded and finely chopped




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the soup, heat the oil in a pan and gently fry the onion, garlic and leek for about 3-4 minutes, or until softened. Add the stock and simmer for 4-5 minutes, then stir in the cream. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper then blend until smooth with a stick blender.


For the croûtes, arrange the slices of bread on a tray and bake in the oven for 2-3 minutes, or until crisp. Remove from the oven, sprinkle over the cheese and chilli and return to the oven for a further 3-4 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.


Serve the soup in a bowl with the croûtes on the side.
