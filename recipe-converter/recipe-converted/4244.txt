Ingredients

1 bottle olives in brine, drained
1 tbsp vinegar
olive oil
1 garlic clove, peeled, sliced
1 chilli, sliced
handful fresh basil leaves




Method


Pour the olives into a bowl. Add enough olive oil to coat the olives.


Add the remaining ingredients and mix well.


Either serve immediately or transfer the olives back to the jar and store in the fridge for 2-3 days.


Experiment by trying alternatives, such as lemon rind, oregano stalks, celery, carrots, peppercorns, bay leaves, or any of your favourite ingredients.
