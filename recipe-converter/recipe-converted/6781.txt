Ingredients

150g/5½oz kalamata olives, stones removed

Method


Place the kalamata olives, garlic and half of the olive oil into a mini food processor and blend to a coarse paste. Slowly add the remaining olive oil until smooth. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Drizzle a little olive oil on the baguette slices. Heat a griddle pan and griddle the baguette slices for 2-3 minutes on each side.


Spread each slice of baguette with the olive tapenade and place on a serving plate.


In a bowl, drizzle the rocket with a little olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place onto the serving plate and serve.
