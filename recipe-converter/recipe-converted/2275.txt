Ingredients

100g/3½oz cream cheese
100ml/3½fl oz double cream, whipped
50g/1¾oz Greek yoghurt
25g/1oz icing sugar
½ lemon, juice only
100g/3½oz ready-made ginger cake, broken into pieces
8 tinned apricot halves, drained and dried with kitchen paper




Method


Place the cream cheese, double cream, yoghurt, icing sugar and lemon juice into a large bowl and mix together well.


Place a 15cm/6in chefs' ring in the centre of a large plate and add the ginger cake, pressing in firmly to form a base.


Add the cream mixture, to cover, and flatten with a palette knife to form a smooth topping layer.


Arrange the apricot halves on top, round-side facing up.


To serve, carefully apply heat from a mini-blowtorch to the sides of the chefs' ring and lift away to reveal the cheesecake.
