An easy mulled wine recipe for the festive season, brimming with Christmassy spice and a kick of sloe gin.



Ingredients

1 bottle red wine
60g/2oz demerara sugar
1 cinnamon stick
grated nutmeg
1 orange, halved
1 dried bay leaf
60ml/2fl oz sloe or damson gin (optional)




Method


Put the wine in a saucepan with the orange, sugar, bayleaf and the spices.


Heat gently until the sugar has dissolved. Taste to see if you want the wine sweeter, and add more sugar to taste.


Off the heat, stir in the sloe or damson gin if you are using it.


Strain into heatproof glasses and serve at once.
