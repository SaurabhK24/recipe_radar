Ingredients

85g/3oz chorizo, sliced
1 garlic clove, chopped
240g/8½oz canned cherry tomatoes, drained
125g/4½oz canned chickpeas, rinsed and drained
50g/2oz olives, stones removed
1 tbsp olive oil
75g/2½oz canned cooked new potatoes, halved
2 tbsp fresh breadcrumbs
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley




Method


Heat a large saucepan and fry the chorizo for 2-3 minutes.


Add the garlic and cook for one minute. Add the cherry tomatoes, chickpeas and olives and cook for 2-3 minutes.


In a separate frying pan, heat the olive oil, add the new potatoes and sauté until golden-brown on all sides. Add the sautéed potatoes to the tomato stew, then pour the mixture into an ovenproof dish.


Preheat the grill to medium.


Place the breadcrumbs and parsley into a small bowl and mix together. Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture over the stew, then place under the grill and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown on top. Serve in the dish.
