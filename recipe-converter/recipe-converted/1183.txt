Method


For the wild boar liquorice, mix all the ingredients in a large bowl or container. Cover and marinate overnight in the refrigerator.


Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5.


For the turnip tops, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Blanch the turnip tops for a minute. Drain and transfer to a bowl of ice-cold water until cool. Drain thoroughly and pat dry.


Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and fry the garlic for a minute. Add the turnip tops and cook for 2-3 minutes until wilted. Set aside.


Remove the wild boar fillets from the marinade. Season with salt. In the same pan used to fry the turnips, fry the fillets on both sides until well coloured. Transfer to an oven tray and roast for 4 minutes.


For the sauce, remove the fat from the frying pan and add the butter. Once melted, add the liquorice liqueur and chicken stock. Simmer for a couple of minutes until hot and slightly thickened.


To serve, divide the wild boar and turnip tops between two serving plates. Pour the sauce over.
