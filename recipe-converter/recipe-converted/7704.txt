Leftover pitta breads that are past their best come into their own here – making a crisp that’s more of a meal.



Ingredients

2 pitta breads (stale is fine)
1 tbsp olive oil or vegetable oil
¼ tsp salt




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.


Open the pitta breads up into two thin halves and cut them into bite-sized strips. Put on a baking tray. Brush the oil over the pitta pieces (or use a spray bottle if you have one). Sprinkle with salt and bake for 10-12 minutes, flipping them halfway through, or until they are golden-brown and crisp.


Allow to cool and store in an airtight container.
