Ingredients

2 tbsp olive oil
220g/8oz paneer, cubed
2 onions, finely sliced
salt and black pepper
2 garlic cloves, crushed
½-1 tsp chilli flakes
1 tbsp mild curry powder
250g/9oz floury potatoes, peeled and cut into small cubes
200g/7oz tinned tomatoes
500ml/18fl oz vegetable stock (made from stock cube)
200g/7oz rice




Method


Heat a saucepan or large (lidded) frying pan over a medium heat. Add the oil and once hot fry the paneer for two minutes on each side, or until the cubes are coloured. Remove from the pan and set aside.


Now add the onions with a pinch of salt and gently fry until golden-brown. Once golden, add the garlic, chilli flakes, curry powder and two tablespoons of water. Gently fry for a further two minutes over a low heat. Stir in the potato.


Pour in the tomatoes and the stock, bring to a simmer, cover with a lid and simmer gently for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are completely soft and the sauce has thickened.


Meanwhile, cook the rice according to packet instructions.


Add the paneer to the curry and stir through, making sure it is well coated in sauce. Heat through for 3-4 minutes then serve with the rice.
