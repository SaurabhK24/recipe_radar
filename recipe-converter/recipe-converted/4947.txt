Homemade Irish cream is a real treat, served it chilled with plenty of ice or sneak a drop into your coffee.






By Mari Williams






Ingredients

250ml/9fl oz single cream
1x 397g/14oz tin condensed milk
350ml/12fl oz Irish whiskey
1 tsp Camp coffee essence
3 tsp chocolate sauce
1 tsp vanilla essence
1 tsp almond essence




Method


Sterilise the bottles for the liqueur: wash in very hot water or on the hot cycle of a dishwasher. Preheat the oven to 160C/325F/Gas 3. Place the bottles on a baking tray and dry in the oven for 10-15 minutes. Leave to cool.


Pour all the ingredients into a blender and blend on high for 30 seconds. Add extra Camp or chocolate to taste.


Pour into sterilised bottles and store in the fridge. (The liqueur will keep for up to two months.) Shake well before using.
