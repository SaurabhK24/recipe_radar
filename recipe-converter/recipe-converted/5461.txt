Ingredients

110g/4oz plain flour
pinch of salt
2 large eggs
200ml/7fl oz milk mixed with 75ml/2fl oz water
2 tbsp melted butter
290ml/½ pint double cream whipped
1 vanilla pod seeds removed
2 tsp icing sugar
200g/7oz frozen mixed fruits
30g/1oz icing sugar
1 tsp dark rum




Method


Sift the flour and add the salt.


Mix in the eggs, then the milk and water mixture.


Add the butter just before using the batter.


Heat a frying pan and rub with oil. Using the batter, for each pancake, make a circle around the edge of the pan and then drizzle the mixture all over the middle of the pan to form a lacy pancake. When cooked, keep warm. Separate the pancakes with layers of greaseproof paper.


Make the compote: place the fruits, sugar and rum in a pan and cook for few minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the fruit from the pan, leaving behind the juices


Whip the cream with the vanilla seeds.


Place the fruits in the centre of each pancake and roll.


Serve with vanilla cream and drizzle over some of the remaining fruit juices.
