Ingredients
For the filling

100g/3½oz sugar
100ml/3½fl oz water
200g/9oz walnuts
1 tbsp butter
3 pears, peeled, core removed, and chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
250g/9oz Stilton, crumbled
1 tbsp finely chopped spinach

For the salsa verde

large bunch flatleaf parsley
15g/½oz fresh mint
1 tbsp fresh tarragon
1 tbsp capers, drained
15g/½oz canned anchovies, drained
1 tbsp Dijon mustard
100ml/3½fl oz olive oil, warmed

To serve

8 sheets fresh pasta, cut into 7.5cm/3in squares, cooked according to packet instructions




Method


For the filling, place the sugar and water into a pan over a high heat and bring to the boil.


Add the walnuts and blanch for 30 seconds, then drain.


Melt the butter in a separate pan over a medium heat. When it begins to foam, add the pears. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and fry for two minutes, stirring occasionally.


Add the blanched walnuts, Stilton and spinach and stir to combine.


For the salsa verde, place the parsley, mint, tarragon, capers, anchovies, mustard and olive oil into a food processor and blend to combine.


To serve, place a square of pasta onto each plate. Place a spoonful of the filling mixture onto the middle of the pasta square, then top with another piece of pasta. Repeat this process until you have used up all of the pasta squares and filling. Drizzle over the salsa verde and serve.
