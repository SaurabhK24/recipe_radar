Ingredients
For the Dover sole

2 whole Dover sole, filleted and pin boned
25g/1oz plain flour, seasoned with salt and pepper
25ml/1fl oz olive oil
50g/1¾oz unsalted butter
1 shallot, finely chopped
1 lemon, juice only
2 tbsp finely chopped parsley
100g/3½oz brown Morecambe Bay shrimps

For the potatoes

600g/1lb 5oz new potatoes, cleaned and peeled
4 tbsp unsalted butter
2 tbsp flatleaf parsley, chopped

For the beans

400g/14oz French beans
2 tbsp unsalted butter
200g/7oz flaked almonds




Method


For the Dover sole, dust the fish in the seasoned flour. Heat a large frying pan and add the oil. Once hot, add the fish skin-side down and cook for a couple of minutes. Turn over and cook for a further minute.


Remove the fish from the pan and set aside to rest.


Heat the butter in a separate frying pan, add the shallot and fry for a few minutes. One it has reached the nut brown stage (or beurre noisette), add the lemon juice, parsley and shrimps and cook for a couple of minutes.


For the beans and potatoes, place the potatoes in a steamer above a large saucepan of salted water. Cook for 15-20 minutes, until done.


Just before serving add the butter, parsley and season with salt and pepper.


Cook the French beans in a separate pan of boiling salted water for 4-5 minutes. Drain and just before serving add the butter and season with salt and pepper.


Heat a small frying pan and add the almonds, toast on a low heat for 2-3 minutes or until golden-brown.


To serve, place the dover sole onto a serving plate, along with the new potatoes and French beans. Top the beans with the toasted almonds.
