Ingredients
For the tomato sauce

1 tbsp olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
200ml/7fl oz passata (or 1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes)
1 tsp chopped fresh oregano (or 1/2 tsp dried oregano)
½ tsp freshly ground black pepper

For the turkey

1 tbsp olive oil
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 red onion, chopped
1 red pepper, seeds and core removed, finely chopped
1 courgette, chopped
170g/6oz turkey mince
85g/3oz cheddar, grated
4 wholemeal tortillas




Method


Preheat oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


To make the sauce heat the olive oil in saucepan over a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and sauté for 4-5 minutes, until softened.


Add the passata, oregano and black pepper. Cover , reduce the heat and leave to simmer for ten minutes.


Meanwhile for the turkey, heat the olive oil in a separate pan over a medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, red pepper and courgette. Sauté for five minutes then add the turkey mince. Cook for around 5-7 minutes, or until the turkey mince is browned and cooked through.


Add half of the cheese to the turkey mixture and continue to cook until the cheese has melted.


Divide the turkey mixture between four tortillas and roll up into parcels. Place into an ovenproof dish, spoon over sauce and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Place into the preheated oven to bake for 15-20 minutes, until golden.
