Ingredients

50g/2oz butter
1 trout fillet
1 tsp sesame seeds
juice of half a lemon




Method


Heat half the butter in a frying pan. Add the trout, skin-side down, and cook for one to two minutes.


Carefully turn the fillet over and finish cooking on the other side for a further two minutes. Remove the trout from the pan and set aside on a warm plate.


Add the remaining butter. When it begins to foam add in the sesame seeds.


When the seeds start to take on colour, squeeze in the lemon juice.


Serve the trout with the beurre noisette sauce poured over the top.
