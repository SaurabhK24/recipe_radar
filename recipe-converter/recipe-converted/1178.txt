Ingredients
For the sole

25g/1oz butter
1 tbsp olive oil
1 lemon sole, filleted and trimmed
salt and freshly ground black pepper
50ml/2fl oz white wine
2 tbsp chopped fresh chives
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley

For the rice

1 tbsp olive oil
1 garlic clove, crushed
55g/2oz sugar snap peas
150g/5½oz long grain rice, cooked according to packet instructions, drained

To serve

1 tbsp flaked almonds, toasted




Method


For the sole, melt the butter in a pan with the olive oil. Score the fish down the centre and rub in the salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fry for 2-3 minutes on both sides, or until golden brown.


Transfer the fish onto a plate, then deglaze the pan briefly with the wine, scraping at the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, then stir in the chives and parsley.


For the rice, heat the olive oil in a pan and gently fry the garlic and peas for 2-3 minutes, or until tender, then stir in the cooked rice and heat through.


Serve the rice with the fish fillets and drizzle over the pan juices. Garnish with the flaked almonds.
