Ingredients
For the pure&eactute;e

½ onion, finely chopped
1 x 400g/14oz can mixed beans, drained and rinsed
1 garlic clove
1 tbsp olive oil

For the naan breads

200g/8oz self-raising flour
1 tsp fresh thyme leaves
2 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped
½ tsp sea salt
water, to bind




Method


for the pureée, place all of the pureée ingredients into a food processor, and blend until smooth. Season, to taste, with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.


For the naan breads, mix together the flour, herbs and salt in a bowl and make a hole in the centre.


Pour water slowly into the centre, and mix from the centre outwards, until it becomes a smooth, soft dough. Shape the dough into six flat ovals and place onto a hot frying pan and dry fry for for three minutes on each side.


To serve, cut the naan breads into strips and serve alongside the pureée.
