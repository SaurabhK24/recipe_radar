Authentic naan needs to be baked in a specially made brick oven, but I decided to shallow fry the dough instead, which gives it this light and fluffy, golden finish.

Ingredients

500g/1lb 2oz strong white flour
10g/¼oz salt
15g/½oz fresh yeast
30ml/1fl oz olive oil
water, to mix
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp caraway seeds




Method


Mix all the ingredients except the cumin and caraway seeds in a large bowl taking care not to put yeast on the top of the salt.


Knead well with your hands and knuckles until the dough is elastic, smooth and shiny. Cover with a piece of cling film and leave to rise for 1 hour.


Push the cumin and caraway seeds into the dough and knead the dough until the seeds are incorporated.


Divide the dough into 2 or 3.


Use a rolling pin to flatten the pieces of dough into rounds, 25cm/10in diameter and rest for a further 5 minutes.


Heat a frying pan to a medium heat and add a splash of olive oil. Shallow fry each dough disc until browned on both sides, then set aside to cool slightly before serving.
