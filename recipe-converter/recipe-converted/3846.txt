A sweet chewy treat, great with morning coffee, afternoon tea, or packed into lunch boxes the next day.

Ingredients

150g/5½oz butter
100g/3½oz golden caster sugar
175ml/6fl oz maple syrup, plus extra for drizzling
200g/7oz rolled oats
100g/3½oz sultanas
10 dried apricots, chopped
2 tbsp ground almonds
5 figs




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


In a large pan melt the butter, sugar and maple syrup. When melted add the oats, sultanas and chopped apricots. Sprinkle over the ground almonds. Stir well.


Tip the contents of the pan into a lined baking tray. Press down so the mixture is evenly distributed. Thinly slice the figs and scatter over the top of the mixture.


Trickle a little maple syrup over the top and bake for 25-30 minutes.
