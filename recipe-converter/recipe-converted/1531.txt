Simon Hopkinson’s calf’s liver recipe is best served with softly creamed potatoes, or polenta.






By Simon Hopkinson


From The Good Cook






Ingredients

2 tbsp olive oil
25g/1oz butter
2 red onions, thinly sliced
salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 thin slices of calf's liver, cut into thin strips
1 tbsp sherry vinegar
1 tbsp crème de cassis
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley




Method


Heat one tablespoon of the olive oil and all of the butter in a heavy-based frying pan. Fry the onions over a low heat for 30 minutes, or until soft. Season lightly with salt and freshly ground black pepper, place into a bowl and set aside.


Heat the remaining olive oil in the frying pan until hot. Season the calf’s liver with salt and freshly ground black pepper and fry for 30 seconds (you should keep it pink inside). Remove and add to the onions in the bowl and mix together.


Place the liver and onions back into the frying pan. Quickly heat through and add the vinegar, crème de cassis and parsley.


Place the liver and onions onto hot plates and serve at once.
