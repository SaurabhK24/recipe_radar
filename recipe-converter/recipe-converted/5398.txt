From I Can Cook






Ingredients

60g/2¼ oz plain flour
40g/1½ oz butter, cut into cubes, softened
½ tsp vanilla extract
20g/¾ caster sugar
6 glacé cherries, chopped




Method


Preheat the oven 180C/350F/Gas 4. Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper.


Put the flour and butter into a mixing bowl and rub together with your fingers until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Stir in the vanilla, sugar and cherries.


Squeeze the mixture into a ball with your hands. Sprinkle a work surface with flour and roll the dough out to a 0.5cm/¼in thickness.


Use a biscuit cutter to cut out shapes and place on the baking tray. Re-roll any leftover dough to make more biscuits.


Bake the biscuits for 12-15 minutes or until pale golden-brown.
