Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
½ shallot, peeled and sliced
85g/3oz cavolo nero (black-leaf kale), chopped
½ red romero pepper, seeds removed and sliced
5 eggs, beaten
55g/2oz Pont l'Évêque cheese




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Heat the oil in a medium ovenproof, non-stick frying pan. Add the shallot and sauté for 2 minutes, to soften.


Add the cavolo nero and the pepper and cook for a further 3-4 minutes.


Add the eggs and cook over a low heat until the egg has set.


Crumble the cheese over the top and then transfer to the oven and cook for 5-6 minutes, until the cheese has melted and is golden.


To serve, remove from the oven, and carefully transfer onto a serving plate, cheese side upwards.
