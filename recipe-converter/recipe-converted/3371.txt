Curing turnips and swede in a salt and spice mixture creates a few small miracles. It extracts the water, which changes both the texture and the flavour; and it creates an extraordinary canvas of sour, sweet, acidity and spice.

Ingredients

450g/14oz turnips, peeled and thinly sliced
200g/7oz swede, peeled and thinly sliced
6 juniper berries, ground to a powder
2 cloves, ground to a powder
grating of mace
1 heaped tsp sea salt
pinch caster sugar
pinch cayenne pepper
3 tbsp duck fat
1½ tbsp Chardonnay vinegar
1 tbsp gin




Method


In a large bowl, mix the turnips and swede with the juniper berries, cloves, mace, salt, sugar and cayenne. Cover and set aside for 3 hours for the vegetable juices to release and exchange flavours.


In a large sauté pan or frying pan over a high heat, sweeten the turnips and swede in the duck fat. Lower the heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. The vegetables should be slightly soft but still have a little bite. Stir in the vinegar and gin, taste and season if required.


Serve immediately or store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks.
