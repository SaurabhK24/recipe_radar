Ingredients
For the bruschetta

2 slices white country-style bread
2 tbsp olive oil

For the topping

1 tbsp olive oil
½ onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
200g/6oz canned tomatoes, strained
salt and freshly ground black pepper
6 fresh basil leaves, torn, plus extra for garnish




Method


For the bruschetta, drizzle the bread with the olive oil and toast in a hot chargrill pan for 2-3 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown and crisp.


For the topping, heat the olive oil in a frying pan and fry the onion and garlic for 2-3 minutes, or until softened, then add the tomatoes and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the tomatoes start to break down slightly, then stir in the basil.


Serve the tomatoes on top of the bruschetta, and garnish with more basil leaves.
