Ready-made gnocchi in a spicy tomato sauce makes a change from pasta and is just as easy to prepare.






By Gino D'Acampo






Ingredients
For the arrabbiata sauce

1 tbsp olive oil
½ onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, chopped
1 green chilli, chopped
1 tbsp white wine vinegar
1 tsp caster sugar
3 plum tomatoes, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the gnocchi

200g/7oz ready-made gnocchi, cooked according to packet instructions
1 tbsp olive oil




Method


For the arrabbiata sauce, heat the oil in a frying pan and gently fry the onion and garlic until soft. Add the chilli, vinegar and sugar and stir well.


Add the chopped tomatoes and simmer until the tomatoes break down and go mushy. Season with salt and pepper.


Put the gnocchi in a serving bowl and drizzle with oil. Season with salt and pepper and stir.


Pour the sauce over the gnocchi and serve.




Recipe Tips
White wine vinegar is handy to have in your store cupboard as it can be used in lots of sauces and dressings. Pick up a bottle for as little as 80p.


  The heat of chillies varies so test a little before adding it to the sauce and adjust the amount accordingly.
