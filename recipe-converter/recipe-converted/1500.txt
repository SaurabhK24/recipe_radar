Ingredients
For the cabbage 'confit'

1 tbsp olive oil
½ red cabbage, shredded
50ml/2fl oz red wine
100g/3½ oz caster sugar
100ml/3½fl oz hot chicken stock (vegetarians may substitute vegetable stock)

For the char-grilled leeks

1 tbsp olive oil
2 baby leeks, cleaned
salt and freshly ground black pepper

To serve

1 tbsp fresh parsley
1 tbsp fresh chives
100g/3½oz breadcrumbs




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


To make the cabbage, heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add the shredded cabbage and red wine and cook for three minutes.


Add the sugar and cook, stirring well, for two minutes.


Add the chicken stock, bring to the boil and reduce the heat to a simmer. Simmer for 5-6 minutes, or until the cabbage has softened.


To make the leeks, heat a griddle pan until smoking. Place the leeks and the olive oil into a large bowl and toss together, seasoning, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Place the leeks onto the hot griddle pan to cook for two minutes on each side, then transfer to the oven to roast for five minutes.


To serve, spoon some of the cabbage into a warm bowl, place the roasted leeks over and sprinkle over some of the herbs and breadcrumbs.
