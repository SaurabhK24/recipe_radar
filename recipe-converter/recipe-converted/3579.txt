50g/2oz mayonnaise
50g/2oz plain live yoghurt

Method


For the dressed crab, place the crabmeat in a bowl, season with salt and smoked paprika. Mix in the mayonnaise, yoghurt, coriander and lemon juice to taste.


Place four metal chef rings onto a tray lined with cling film and spoon the mixture into them. Chill in the fridge until needed.


For the caper and egg salad, place the eggs into boiling water and cook for six minutes, or until hard boiled. Remove the eggs from the water and refresh in cold water. Peel and coarsely chop.


In a bowl, mix the chopped eggs, capers, lemon zest and parsley. Bind the mixture together with the salad cream and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, place the metal rings with the dressed crab onto serving plates then carefully remove the rings. Garnish with the egg and caper salad and rocket and serve with the toasted bread.
