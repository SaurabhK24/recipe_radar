Stir fries are quick and tasty. It all cooks in the same pan - add as much veg as you want. You do need some rice that has already been cooked, so prepare that in advance, or use leftover rice you’ve kept in the fridge.



Ingredients

1 tsp rapeseed oil
4 spring onions, finely sliced
1 red pepper, seeded and finely sliced
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
175g/6oz broccoli, cut into small florets
300g/10½oz cooked basmati rice, (cooked and cooled)
120g/4oz frozen peas
3 eggs, lightly beaten
1 tbsp soy sauce
2 tsp toasted sesame seeds
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 tbsp finely chopped fresh coriander leaves




Method


Heat a wok until hot, add the oil and spring onions and red pepper and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes until just softened. Add the garlic and stir through, then add the broccoli and 4 tablespoons of water. Bring to the boil and simmer for 2 minutes until just tender and the water has nearly evaporated.


Add the rice to the wok and stir fry for 2-3 minutes. By now the vegetables should be tender and the rice hot through. Stir in the peas cook for 1 minute. Meanwhile, in a bowl, use a fork to mix together the eggs and soy sauce.


Add the eggs to the rice and continue to stir-fry for 2-3 minutes or until the eggs have just set. Stir in the sesame seeds, then season with salt and pepper and stir in the coriander. Serve immediately.
