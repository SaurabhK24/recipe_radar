These tomatoes are ‘drowned’ in olive oil and flavoured with garlic and mixed herbs. Bottle up this taste of a Mediterranean summer to use as a sauce at a later date.

Ingredients

500ml/18fl oz olive oil
1 bulb of garlic, cut in half horizontally
handful mixed savoury herbs
500g/1lb 2oz mixed tomatoes
salt and pepper




Method


Heat half of the oil in a pan. Add the garlic (cut-side down) and mixed herbs.


Halve any large tomatoes.


Add the tomatoes to the pan and cook over a low heat for about 30 minutes. Add salt and pepper, to taste.


Once the tomato is soft, remove the garlic. Decant the mixture into a sterilised bottle and pour over the remaining oil to cover. It is important that the tomatoes are completely covered with oil, so add more oil if it is not enough to cover.




Recipe Tips
Store the tomatoes in the fridge and eat within a week.
