A great way to use up the Christmas turkey. Make the filling in advance then add the pastry top and bake just before serving.

Ingredients

butter, for frying
1 large onion, chopped
2 large carrots, sliced into lozenges
2 large leeks, sliced into 2cm/Â¾in pieces, washed
200ml/7fl oz double cream
200ml/7fl oz chicken or turkey stock
500g/1lb 2oz cooked turkey, cut into bite-size pieces
200g/7oz cooked ham, cut into bite-size pieces
10 button mushrooms
pinch cayenne pepper
2 tbsp chopped tarragon
thyme leaves
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
225g/8oz frozen puff pastry, defrosted
1 free-range egg, beaten
2 tbsp parmesan, finely grated




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Heat a large pan over a medium heat. Add a knob of butter and gently cook the onion until soft but not brown. Add the carrots and leek and continue cooking for five minutes until the carrots begin to soften. Cover with the cream and stock and simmer until the sauce starts to thicken. Add the turkey, ham, mushrooms, cayenne and herbs then season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper and remove the pan from the heat.


Pour the filling into a ceramic pie dish. Roll out the pastry to make a lid for the pie and strips to line the rim of the dish. Press the strips onto the rim, moistening them with a little water, then press down the lid firmly and brush with the beaten egg. Sprinkle with the parmesan and cook in the oven for 20 minutes until the pastry is golden-brown.




Recipe Tips
For a thicker pie filling, mix equal amounts of cornflour and water in a small bowl and stir this into the filling to thicken.
