Ingredients

4 raw whole beetroot
200ml/7fl oz extra virgin olive oil
1 lime, juice only
75ml/3fl oz cabernet sauvignon vinegar
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp olive oil
300g/10½oz halloumi cheese, thickly sliced
50g/2oz capers in vinegar, drained
baby rocket, to serve




Method


Thinly slice the beetroot on a mandoline and arrange in a shallow container.


Mix together the extra virgin olive oil, lime juice and vinegar, then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pour the mixture over the beetroot, cover and chill for 30 minutes in the fridge.


When ready to serve, heat the olive oil in a pan. Season the halloumi with salt and freshly ground black pepper and fry for 2-3 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown all over. Remove from the pan and drain on kitchen paper.


To serve, arrange a ring of beetroot on each of four serving plates, then top the beetroot with the halloumi. Sprinkle over the capers and top each plate with a small handful of baby rocket.
