Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
150g/5oz king prawns, cut in half
150g/5oz squid, cut into strips
150g/5oz crab meat
1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
2 tbsp sweet chilli sauce
1 tbsp Thai fish sauce (nam pla)
2 tbsp lime juice
1 tbsp clear honey
2 red chillies, finely sliced
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
1 tbsp chopped fresh mint leaves
2 tbsp sesame seeds
4 fresh kaffir lime leaves, very finely shredded
3 heads of chicory, leaves separated to give you approximately 30 neat 'boats' for the filling




Method


Heat a frying pan until hot, then add the oil and stir fry the prawns for 1-2 minutes. Then add the squid and cook for one more minute. Add the crab meat and heat through. Remove from the heat and place in a bowl.


Combine all the other ingredients, except the chicory, and pour onto the seafood. Stir gently and leave to marinate for 30 minutes.


To serve, drain the seafood of any excess liquid and divide the mixture between the chicory boats.
