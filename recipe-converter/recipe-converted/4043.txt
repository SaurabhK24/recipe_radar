These fruity flapjacks are a tasty treat for kids hankering after something sweet and are packed with energy.





By Kate Morris and Sally Brown


From I Can Cook on the Go






Ingredients

1 small eating apple, peeled, core removed, grated
30g/1¼oz mixed dried fruit
50g/2oz rolled oats
1 heaped tbsp demerara sugar
3 tbsp apple juice
1 tsp vegetable oil, plus extra for greasing




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Grease a loaf tin with a little vegetable oil.


In a bowl, mix together the grated apple, dried fruit, oats and sugar until well combined. Stir in the apple juice and oil.


Scoop the mixture into the prepared loaf tin and flatten it into the corners using a palette knife.


Bake in the oven for about 25 minutes, or until the oats are golden-brown. Set aside to cool slightly, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.


To serve, cut into four fingers.
