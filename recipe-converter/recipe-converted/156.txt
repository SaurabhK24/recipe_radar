Ingredients

450g/1lb chicken thigh fillets, trimmed of fat and each one cut into 4 strips
75g/2Â½oz plain yoghurt
2 tbsp tikka spice curry blend
small bunch fresh coriander, chopped (optional)
lime wedges, to serve




Method


Mix the chicken strips, yoghurt and tikka paste together in a bowl. Cover with cling film and set aside in the fridge to marinate for 20 minutes, or up to 4 hours. Soak the bamboo skewers in water for at least 20 minutes.


Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Place 2 baking trays in the oven to preheat.


Thread 1 or 2 strips of chicken onto each skewer, not too tightly as this may cause uneven cooking. Place the chicken skewers onto the preheated baking trays, spaced well apart and bake for 20 minutes, turning half-way through. You may need to tip some cooking juices out of the baking tray when you turn them so that the skewers brown up nicely.


Check that the chicken is completely cooked before serving. Serve scattered with freshly chopped coriander and lime wedges on the side.
