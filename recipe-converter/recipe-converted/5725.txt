Finish off a dinner party in style with this zesty lemon, raspberry and passion fruit meringue recipe.

  Equipment and preparation: You’ll need a Swiss roll tin.






By Simon Rimmer


From Something for the Weekend






Ingredients

4 free-range egg whites
200g/7oz caster sugar
icing sugar, for dusting
200g/7oz lemon curd
3 passion fruit, seeds only
175g/6oz double cream, whipped with 25g/1oz icing sugar
200g/7oz fresh raspberries




Method


Preheat the oven to 175C/325F/Gas 3. Grease and line a Swiss roll tin.


Place the egg whites into a bowl and whisk until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl.


Whisk in the sugar, one spoonful at a time, only adding more when the previous spoon has fully combined, until all the sugar is used.


Spoon the mixture onto the Swiss roll tin and bake in the oven for 15 minutes.


Dust a piece of greaseproof paper with icing sugar. Turn the meringue out of the tin and set aside to cool.


Meanwhile, mix together the lemon curd and passion fruit seeds in a bowl until well combined.


Spread the filling over the meringue. Add the whipped cream and cover with the raspberries.


Whilst holding the greaseproof paper, carefully roll up the meringue lengthways into a roulade shape. Dust with more icing sugar and slice into portions to serve.
