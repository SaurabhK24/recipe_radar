Ingredients
For the cheese sauce

5 tbsp double cream
1 free-range egg yolk
55g/2oz cheddar, grated
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the chutney

1 tbsp olive oil
1 garlic clove, chopped
6 cherry tomatoes, halved, plus one extra to garnish
4-5 pickled walnuts, drained and chopped
1 tbsp caster sugar
1 tbsp white wine vinegar
sprig fresh thyme, leaves only

For the toast

2 slices rustic bread
1 tbsp olive oil
sprig fresh chervil, to serve




Method


For the cheese sauce, place the cream into a small pan and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat, add the egg yolk and grated cheddar and stir well to combine and melt the cheese. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, set aside and keep warm.


For the chutney, heat the olive oil in a small pan, add all the remaining chutney ingredients and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 3-4 minutes.


Meanwhile, for the toast, heat a griddle pan. Brush the bread with olive oil and toast on both sides.


Place one piece of toast onto a serving plate and pour over half the cheese sauce. Top with the second piece of toast and pour over the remaining sauce.


To serve, garnish with a cherry tomato and a sprig of chervil and serve the warm chutney alongside.
