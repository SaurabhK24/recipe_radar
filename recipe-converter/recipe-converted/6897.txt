Ingredients

1 tsp coriander seeds
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 garlic clove
1 tbsp maple syrup
Â¼ tsp fresh ginger, grated
3 lamb cutlets, flattened with the base of a saucepan or meat tenderiser




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


In a mortar and pestle, crush the coriander seeds, cumin seeds and garlic clove to make a paste.


Add the maple syrup and ginger and mix well.


In a hot griddle pan, fry the cutlets for 30 seconds on each side, until browned.


Remove the lamb cutlets from the pan and roll in the spice marinade.


Transfer the lamb to an ovenproof dish and roast for five minutes, or until cooked to your liking.


Set aside to rest for five minutes before serving.
