Warm up a wintry salad with grilled pears. A great one for Christmas when there's plenty of stilton about!

From Housecall






Ingredients

2 comice pears
150g/5½oz watercress
110g/4oz stilton
30g/1oz walnut halves
½ baguette
15g/½oz chopped parsley
½ lemon, juice only

For the dressing

1½ tbsp walnut oil
1½ tbsp olive oil
½ tsp mustard
1 tbsp white wine vinegar
pinch of sugar
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.


First heat a non-stick griddle pan until very hot. Cut the pear in half and remove the core. Brush the pear flesh with lemon juice. When the pan is hot place the pear on to the griddle pan and cook for 2-3 minutes. Turn over and cook the other side. When the pear is cooked and nicely marked remove from the pan.


Slice the bread into long strips and place on to an oven tray. Drizzle with a little olive oil, season with salt. Bake for 5 minutes until crisp and dry but not too brown.


Place the watercress on the serving plate and dot the pears around. Break the cheese into pieces and place over the top. Sprinkle over the walnuts and parsley.


Mix all the dressing together in a bowl and season. Add the strips of bread to the salad. Drizzle over the dressing and serve.
