Ingredients

500g/17½oz mixed berries (blueberries, raspberries, blackberries)
3 tbsp sugar, or more to taste
splash water
500g/17½oz ready-made plain sponge cake
250ml/9fl oz ready-made custard
icing sugar, to serve (optional)




Method


Bring the raspberries, blackberries and blueberries to the boil in a saucepan with the sugar and a little water. Simmer for a few minutes until the fruits burst. Set aside.


Slice the sponge cake into thin pieces and place these in a bowl or in four individual soup plates. Spoon over the warm fruits and some of their syrup. Trickle over the custard and, if you wish, dust with icing sugar.
