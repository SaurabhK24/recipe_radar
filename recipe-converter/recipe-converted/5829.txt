Ingredients

1-2 tbsp vegetable oil
1kg/2lb potatoes, peeled and diced into 1cm/½in cubes
½ tsp dried turmeric
½ tsp red chilli powder
salt

For the five spice mix (Panchporan)

1 tbsp cumin seeds
1 tbsp fennel seeds
1 tbsp fenugreek seeds
1 tbsp nigella seeds
1 tbsp black mustard seeds

For the tempering

1 tsp vegetable oil
2 tsp five spice mix (panchphoran)
1 green chilli finely chopped
1 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped




Method


In a wide non-stick pan, heat the oil to a medium-high heat and add the potatoes.


Sauté the potatoes until they are nearly cooked. Add the turmeric, chilli powder and salt and fry until they are cooked through.


In a separate small shallow frying pan heat the oil until it begins to smoke. Mix together the five spice mix ingredients, and add two teaspoons to the hot pan. The seeds will crackle and pop, so be careful when handling the mixture. Add the green chillies and the chopped coriander and stir for a few seconds. Pour this mixture onto the cooked potatoes.


Serve immediately.
