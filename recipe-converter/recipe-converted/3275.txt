Ingredients
For the noodles

100g/3½oz thin rice noodles
300ml/10½fl oz vegetable oil

For the pesto

½ red chilli, seeds removed and roughly chopped
1 garlic clove, roughly chopped
5 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
2 tbsp chopped cashew nuts
2 tbsp sesame oil

To serve

½ red chilli, seeds removed and finely chopped
2 tsp soy sauce




Method


For the noodles, heat the oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns golden brown in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended).


Lower the noodles into the hot oil and deep-fry until crisp and golden. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


For the pesto, place all of the pesto ingredients into a food processor and blend until smooth.


To serve, place the crisp noodles into a bowl, add the chilli and soy sauce and mix well. Add a spoonful of pesto and serve.
