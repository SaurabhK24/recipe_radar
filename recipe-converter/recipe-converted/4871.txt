Ingredients
For the chicken

Â½ chicken breast, cut in half lengthways
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
1 tbsp chopped fresh rosemary, leaves only
1 tbsp olive oil

For the roasted tomatoes

85g/3oz cherry vine tomatoes, whole
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 tsp caster sugar




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the chicken, mix the seasoning and herbs in a bowl, and press the chicken pieces into the mixture, turning them until each piece is completely coated.


Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the chicken and fry for 8-10 minutes, turning halfway through cooking, until cooked through, golden-brown and crisp on both sides.


For the tomatoes, place the tomatoes in a small, ovenproof frying pan. Drizzle the oil and vinegar over the tomatoes, and sprinkle them evenly with sugar. Place in the oven to roast for 5-10 minutes.


To serve, place the chicken on a plate with the balsamic tomatoes on the side.
