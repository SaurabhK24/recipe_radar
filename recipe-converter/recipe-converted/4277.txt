Ingredients
For the tagliatelle

500ml/18fl oz vegetable oil
50g/1¾oz ready-made filo pastry, cut into tagliatelle-like strips

For the topping

1 tsp ground ginger
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp icing sugar
50g/1¾oz skinned, chopped almonds
50g/1¾oz sultanas
2 scoops vanilla ice cream
2 tbsp runny honey




Method


In a deep fat fryer or large saucepan, heat the vegetable oil until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended!)


Deep fry the filo tagliatelle for about 2-3 minutes, until crisp and golden. Carefully remove the strips with a slotted spoon and drain onto kitchen towels.


Combine the ginger, cinnamon and icing sugar, and dust this topping over the tagliatelle.


Sprinkle with nuts and sultanas, scoop the ice cream on top and drizzle over the honey.
