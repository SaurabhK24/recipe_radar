Ingredients
For the cake

100g/3½oz red apples, peeled, core removed
150g/5oz soft fudge, cut into small cubes
1 tbsp mixed spice
1 tsp ground cinnamon, plus extra for dusting
175g/6oz unsalted butter, softened
150g/5oz dark soft brown sugar
2 free-range eggs
250g/9oz plain flour
2 tsp baking powder
clotted cream , to serve
icing sugar, for dusting




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease and line a 20cm/8in loose-bottomed cake tin.


Slice one of the apples into 1cm/½in slices and chop the remaining apples into small cubes.


Sprinkle half of the fudge into the bottom of the tin and arrange the apple dslices on top.


Place the cubed apple and spices in a bowl and mix together until the apples are coated in the spices. Add half of the apple cubes to the cake tin.


Cream the butter and sugar together in a bowl until pale and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, then the flour and baking powder until well combined. Fold in the remaining apple and fudge. Bake in the oven for an hour, or until a skewer inserted into the middle of the cakes comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven and set aside to cool slightly.


To serve, remove the cake from the tin, dust with icing sugar and cinnamon and serve slices with a spoonful of clotted cream.
