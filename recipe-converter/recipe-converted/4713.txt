Ingredients

225g/8oz self-raising flour
1 tsp baking powder
100g/3½oz courgette, grated
salt and freshly ground black pepper
75g/2¾oz Gruyère, grated
175ml/6fl oz full fat milk
1 free-range egg, beaten
75ml/2¾fl oz olive oil, plus extra for greasing
1 tbsp chopped fresh rosemary
butter, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease 5 of the holes in a 12-hole muffin tray with olive oil.


Mix the flour, baking powder, courgette, seasoning and 50g/1¾oz of the cheese together in a bowl.


In a separate bowl, whisk the milk, egg and olive oil together until well combined. Add the liquid mixture and rosemary to the dry ingredients and mix until well combined.


Divide the mixture among the muffin holes and bake for 10 minutes in the oven, then sprinkle over the remaining cheese. Bake for a further 10-15, or until risen and golden-brown.


Serve the muffins warm, with butter.




Recipe Tips
For quick assembly, mix the dry ingredients and wet ingredients in separate bowls the night before. Cover with cling film and store in the fridge, then mix together in the morning, divide the mixture among the muffin holes and pop into the oven.
