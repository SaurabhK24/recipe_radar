Ingredients

1 tbsp butter
½ shallot, finely chopped
100g/3½oz new potatoes, peeled and chopped
½ large fennel bulb, chopped
150ml/¼ pint hot chicken stock (vegetarians can substitute vegetable stock)
salt and freshly ground black pepper
small handful fresh dill, chopped




Method


Heat the butter in a pan and gently fry the shallot until softened but not coloured.


Add the new potatoes and fennel and sauté for 2-3 minutes.


Add the stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 8-10 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and allow to cool slightly.


Pour the soup into a blender, add the dill and blend until smooth. If necessary, gently reheat the soup before serving.


To serve, pour the soup into a serving bowl.
