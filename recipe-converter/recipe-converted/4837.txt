From Nigel and Adam's Farm Kitchen






Ingredients

1kg/2lb 4oz new potatoes
a little olive oil
200g/7oz chopped hazelnuts
150g/5½oz butter




Method


Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.


Roughly chop the new potatoes into quarters, but at odd angles.


Heat a dash of olive oil in an oven dish. Add the potatoes and brown them on the hob over a moderate heat.


Roughly chop the hazelnuts.


Heat the butter in a pan until it is almost going a nutty brown colour.


Pour the butter over the potatoes and mix in the hazelnuts.


Bake in the oven for one hour 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are crisp and golden-brown.
