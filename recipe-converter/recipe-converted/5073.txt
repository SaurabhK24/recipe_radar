Ingredients

1 large parsnip
35g/1¼oz butter

Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Peel and core the parsnip and cut it into wedges.


Heat the butter in an ovenproof frying pan and add the parsnip wedges. Fry until they begin to colour. Drizzle over the honey and sprinkle over the sugar.


Stir to combine and then place the pan into the oven. Roast for 15-20 minutes, or until the parsnips are golden-brown and tender. Serve.
