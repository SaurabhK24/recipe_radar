Ingredients

225g/8oz chicken breast, cut into 16 slices
48 prawns, defrost if frozen
4 large bunches of coriander, washed and chopped roughly
5 large red chillies, cut into thin julienne strips
salt and pepper to taste
8 spring roll wrappers
oil for deep-frying




Method


Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Place a slice of chicken diagonally across the spring roll pastry.


Lay 6 prawns on top of the chicken slice. Top with two to three chilli strips and a handful of coriander.


Place another slice of chicken over the coriander.


Fold in ends of pastry and roll up in an envelope shape. Secure with a cocktail stick.


Deep-fry the chicken and prawn rolls in hot oil until golden brown and cooked through, about 2-3 minutes. Do not have oil too hot or the rolls will brown before the filling is cooked through.


Drain on absorbent kitchen towels.


Remove cocktail stick from each roll.
