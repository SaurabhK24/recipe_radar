This is a great recipe for feeding large groups of people as the breadcrumb mixture can be made well in advance. You will need several large roasting tins.

Ingredients

800g/1lb 12oz crusty bread
400g/14oz cold butter, diced
200g/7oz flatleaf parsley, finely chopped
100g/3Â½oz chives, snipped
5 lemons, zest only
sea salt and freshly ground pepper
6kg/13lb skinless ling fillets, or other white fish
5 tbsp sunflower oil




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Tear the bread into chunks, place in a food processor and pulse to make coarse breadcrumbs.


Add the butter, parsley, chives and lemon zest then pulse again until thoroughly blended. You may have to do this in batches. Season the breadcrumb mixture with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Place the fish fillets in large roasting tins, scatter over the breadcrumb mixture then bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes or until the fish is cooked through.


Serve the fish with mashed potatoes and peas.
