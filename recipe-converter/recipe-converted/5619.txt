Ingredients
For the Vacherin

350g/10oz round of Vacherin (or other similar boxed cheese)
1 bunch fresh rosemary
ciabatta bread, sliced

For the chutney

small bunch grapes, sliced in half
½ red onion, finely chopped
1 tbsp olive oil
2 cherry tomatoes, seeds removed and finely chopped
2 tbsp brown sugar
3 tbsp red wine vinegar




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the cheese, remove the top rind of the cheese with a spoon and poke in sprigs of fresh rosemary.


Place onto a baking sheet and place into the oven to bake for 15-20 minutes, or until melted and cooked through.


For the chutney, place all of the chutney ingredients into a saucepan over a high heat. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to gently simmer for 15 minutes.


Heat a griddle pan until smoking. Place the slices of ciabatta onto the griddle and cook until toasted on both sides.


Serve the Vacherin in its box with the ciabatta alongside for dipping.
