Ingredients
For the monkfish

200g/7oz monkfish, trimmed
3 slices prosciutto
freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil

For the sauce

2 tbsp olive oil
3 spring onions, chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
140g/5oz cherry tomatoes, halved
3 fresh basil leaves, chopped

For the spinach

200g/7oz spinach
1 tbsp olive oil




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Wrap the monkfish in the prosciutto and season with freshly ground black pepper.


Heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan and fry the monkfish for 2-3 minutes, until it is browned on both sides.


Transfer into the oven for eight minutes or until completely cooked through. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for five minutes.


For the sauce, heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed frying pan and fry the spring onion and garlic for one minute. Add the tomatoes and basil leaves to the pan and stir well.


For the spinach, heat the oil in a separate pan and add the spinach for two minutes, stirring until wilted down.


To serve, place the monkfish onto a plate and place alongside the spinach. Top with the tomato sauce.
