A splash of ginger cordial adds a twist to this classic, super-quick dessert.






By James Martin


From Stately Suppers






Ingredients

500g/1lb 2oz strawberries, hulls removed
400ml/14fl oz double cream
3 x 7.5cm/3in ready-made meringue nests, crushed
1 tbsp ginger cordial (optional)
sprigs of fresh mint, to garnish




Method


Purée half the strawberries in a blender. Chop the remaining strawberries, reserving four for decoration.


Whip the double cream until stiff peaks form, then fold in the strawberry purée and crushed meringue. Fold in the chopped strawberries and ginger cordial, if using.


Spoon equal amounts of the mixture into four cold wine glasses. Serve garnished with the remaining strawberries and a sprig of mint.
