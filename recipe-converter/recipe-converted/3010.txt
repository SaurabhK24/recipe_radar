Ingredients
For the tart

100g/3½oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting
2 tbsp olive oil
1 free-range egg, yolk only
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2-3 tsp cold water, to bind
½ courgette, sliced into rounds
2 vine tomatoes, sliced into rounds
55g/2oz mozzarella cheese, sliced
6 pitted black olives

For the tomato sauce

2 tbsp tomato purée
2 tbsp water

For the parsley purée

1 handful fresh parsley leaves
2 tbsp olive oil




Method


Preheat the grill to medium.


For the tart, place the flour, olive oil, egg yolk, salt and freshly ground black pepper into a food processor and pulse until well combined. Gradually add a little cold water, just enough to bring the mixture together into a dough.


Place the dough out onto a floured work surface and lightly knead, then roll out into a 5mm/¼in thick round, big enough to fit inside an ovenproof frying pan.


Heat the pan and place the dough into the bottom. Arrange the courgette and tomato slices in a spiral pattern on top, then place under the grill and cook for 4-5 minutes, until the pastry is golden-brown and the courgette and tomato begin to soften. Remove from the grill and arrange the mozzarella and black olives on top. Return to the grill and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until the mozzarella is melted.


For the tomato sauce, place the tomato purée and water in a pan and heat through, stirring well.


For the parsley purée, place the parsley and oil together in a mini food processor and blend until smooth.


Carefully place the tart onto a serving plate and drizzle over the tomato sauce and parsley purée. Serve.
