Ingredients

340g/12oz bunch thin asparagus
sea salt
iced water
1 tsp Dijon mustard
1 tbsp lemon juice
3 tbsp olive oil
6 radishes, cut into 3mm batons
1 tsp chopped fresh tarragon
1 tsp chopped fresh chervil
1 tsp chopped fresh parsley
1 tsp chopped chives
freshly ground black pepper




Method


Cook the asparagus in boiling salted water for 3 minutes, until just tender. Remove using a slotted spoon and plunge into iced water. Drain well and place on a board.


Remove the tips and set aside. Cut the stalks into 2.5cm/1in pieces.


Meanwhile, make a dressing. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the mustard and lemon juice to form an emulsion. Gradually add the oil, whisking continuously.


Add the pieces of asparagus stalk and the radishes and mix until evenly coated. Add the herbs and mix again. Season with salt and pepper.


Pile the dressed asparagus stalks on a platter and scatter the reserved tips over the top. Pour over any remaining dressing.
