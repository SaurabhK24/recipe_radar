Ingredients

6 medium-sized pears, peeled but stalks left on
2 tbsp lemon juice
450ml/16fl oz water
200g/7oz caster sugar

For the chocolate sauce

150ml/5oz double cream
200g/7oz dark chocolate, roughly chopped




Method


Brush the peeled pears with a little lemon juice.


Heat the water to a simmer in a large pan and add the sugar. Leave the sugar and water to simmer until it has slightly thickened, before adding the pears to the pan.


Cover the pan and poach the pears for 25 minutes.


Carefully remove the pears from the poaching liquid and transfer to six individual serving plates.


Pour the double cream into a clean pan and heat gently, without boiling.


Take the pan off the heat and add the chopped chocolate, stirring to make a smooth sauce.


To serve, pour the chocolate sauce over the pears.
