Sweet and buttery squash paired with fragrant sage and crème fraîche for a bit of zing.






By Allegra McEvedy






Ingredients

60g/2½oz butter
10 fresh sage leaves, chopped
1.5kg/3lb 5oz butternut squash, peeled, seeds removed, cut into 2cm/1in pieces
large pinch chilli flakes
40g/1½oz parmesan (or a similar vegetarian hard cheese), coarsley grated
6 tbsp crème fraîche
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Melt the butter in a wide, heavy-based, lidded pan over a low heat. When the butter is foaming, add the sage and fry one minute.


Add the butternut squash pieces and chilli flakes. Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the squash is tender, stirring occasionally.


Lightly mash the squash, using a fork, then stir in the parmesan and crème fraîche until well combined. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
