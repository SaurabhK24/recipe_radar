125g/4oz quark cheese (or other soft cheese)
50ml/2fl oz double cream, whipped
100g/3½oz tinned cherries
1 sprig fresh mint

Method


Place the macaroon biscuit at the base of a 7cm/3in chefs' ring.


Place the cream and the quark into a bowl and mix together well.


Place the cream and cheese mixture onto the top of the biscuit in the chefs' ring and place into the fridge for ten minutes to set.


Remove from the fridge and place onto a serving plate and release the cheesecake from the chefs' ring by warming the sides of the ring with a mini-blowtorch.
