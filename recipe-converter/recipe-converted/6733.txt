Ingredients
For the noodle soup

1 tbsp sesame oil
1 tbsp soy sauce
2.5cm/1in piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely sliced
pinch chilli flakes
150ml/5fl oz hot vegetable stock
100g/3½oz ready-cooked udon noodles

For the teriyaki beef

1 tbsp olive oil
100g/3½oz beef fillet
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp clear honey

To serve

1 tbsp cashew nuts, lightly toasted




Method


For the noodle soup, place all the noodle soup ingredients except for the noodles into a saucepan and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for five minutes.


For the teriyaki beef, rub the beef all over with olive oil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Heat a frying pan until hot and fry the beef for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking. Remove the beef from the pan and set aside to rest in a warm place. Add the soy sauce and honey to the pan and stir, then remove the pan from the heat.


Cut the beef into thin slices and stir around in the pan of soy mixture to coat all over in the pan juices.


To serve, place the noodles into a bowl and pour over the soup. Top with the sliced beef and sprinkle over the cashew nuts.
