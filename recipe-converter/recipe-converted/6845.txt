Recapture the bygone flavour of this popular French dessert.

  Equipment and preparation: You’ll need four large dariole moulds or ramekins.






By Simon Hopkinson


From The Good Cook






Ingredients

4 large oranges, zest only
75g/2½oz caster sugar
500ml/17fl oz full-fat milk
120g/4oz granulated sugar
3 free-range eggs
4 free-range egg yolks




Method


Blend the zest and caster sugar to a fine powder in a food processor.


Put the orange zest and caster sugar mixture into a saucepan, add the milk and warm together, occasionally stirring, until just below simmering point. Switch off the heat, cover with a lid and leave to infuse for at least one hour.


Put the granulated sugar into a heavy-based saucepan and add 3-4 tablespoons of cold water. Bring to a simmer and cook slowly until the sugar has turned to a richly coloured caramel.


Pour the caramel into the base of the four dariole moulds and set aside to cool.


Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.


Put the eggs and yolks into a roomy bowl, beat together lightly and then strain over the orange-infused milk. Gently beat the mixture together until well combined. Remove any froth from the surface with a spoon and strain the mixture to make it smooth.


Ladle the mixture into the caramel-lined moulds and fill to the brim. Place them into a deep roasting tin and fill with hot (not boiling) water, so that it rises up the outside of the molds by about three-quarters of the way up. Carefully place the tin into the oven and loosely lay a sheet of tin foil flat over the surface of the moulds, but don't secure it down. Bake in the oven until the custards are just set (about 40 minutes) - lightly press a finger on the surface, or give them a little shake; they should gently wobble.


Remove from the oven, take out from the roasting tin and leave to cool. Cover each mould with a small sheet of clingfilm and chill in the fridge for at least two hours.


To unmould, run a small knife around the edge of the custard and upend onto individual, shallow dishes.
