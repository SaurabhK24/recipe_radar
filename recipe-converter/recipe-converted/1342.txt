Ingredients

450g/1lb young fresh broad beans in their pods
50ml/2fl oz olive oil
2 onions, chopped
2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped
½ lemon, juice only
250ml/½ pint vegetable stock
2 tbsp fresh chopped dill
a dollop of Greek-style yoghurt (optional)




Method


Wash the beans, top, tail and string them where necessary.


Heat the oil in a large heavy-lidded pan and add the onions and garlic. Cook for 2-3 minutes to soften. Add the beans in their pods and the lemon juice and toss to combine.


Add the stock, bring to the boil and cook for 20-25 minutes until the pods are very tender. Cover and reduce heat to a gentle simmer.


At the end of cooking, add the dill. Serve warm. Add a generous dollop of Greek-style yoghurt (optional).
