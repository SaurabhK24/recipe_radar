Ingredients
For the sole

1 lemon sole fillet, cut into three pieces
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil
15g/Â½oz butter
25g/1oz cooked brown shrimps

For the salad

2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 tbsp white wine vinegar
1 tsp wholegrain mustard
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
1 tbsp chopped fresh chervil
1 tbsp chopped fresh dill




Method


Season the lemon sole pieces, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Heat the oil and butter in a frying pan over a medium heat and add the lemon sole pieces, skin-side down. Fry for 3-4 minutes, then carefully turn the lemon sole pieces over and continue to cook until the fish is opaque and golden-brown on both sides. Remove the lemon sole pieces from the pan, set aside on a warm plate, then add the brown shrimps to the pan and heat for a further 1-2 minutes, or until warmed through.


For the salad, whisk the olive oil, white wine vinegar and wholegrain mustard together in a large bowl until well combined. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add the herbs and mix thoroughly.


To serve, spoon the salad onto a serving plate. Top with the lemon sole pieces and spoon over the brown shrimps.
