By Antony Worrall Thompson


From Saturday Kitchen






Ingredients

350g/12oz broccoli, florets and stalks cut into small pieces
400ml/14fl oz vegetable stock
25g/1oz butter
4 spring onions, finely sliced
50g/1¾oz Stilton, crumbled, or to taste
100ml/3½fl oz double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper
pinch freshly grated nutmeg

For the croûtons

4 slices French bread
100g/3½oz Stilton, sliced




Method


For the soup, place the pieces of broccoli into a glass bowl. Pour over the vegetable stock.


Cover the bowl with cling film and place in the microwave. Cook on full power for four minutes, or until tender.


Meanwhile, heat a frying pan until hot then add the butter. When it starts to foam, add the spring onions and cook for one minute.


Transfer the cooked broccoli and stock to a food processor. Add the fried spring onions, Stilton and cream and blend until smooth.


Transfer the blended mixture to a pan and bring gently to a simmer.


Meanwhile, for the croûtons, toast the French bread under a grill until golden-brown on each side.


Top the grilled bread with the slices of Stilton and return to the grill until golden-brown and bubbling.


Season the soup with salt, freshly ground black pepper and a pinch of nutmeg.


Divide the soup equally among four warm bowls and top each with a Stilton croûton. Serve.
