Ingredients

1 potato, diced
25g/1oz butter
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp olive oil
¼ savoy cabbage, shredded




Method


Heat a large saucepan of water until boiling.


Add the potato and cook for ten minutes, or until soft. Drain the water and mash the potato with the butter and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Heat half the oil in a wok and stir-fry the savoy cabbage for two minutes.


Mix the cabbage with the mashed potato, stirring through thoroughly.


Heat a small frying pan with the remaining oil and add the potato mixture filling the pan. Cook on a medium heat for five minutes, or until browned and turn out onto a plate. Serve immediately.
