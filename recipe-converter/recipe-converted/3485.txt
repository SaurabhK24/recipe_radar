Ingredients

1 aubergine, cut in half lengthways
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
75g/2½oz chorizo
1 tomato, finely chopped
50g/1¾oz spinach, chopped
75g/2½oz ricotta cheese




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Scoop some of the flesh out of the middle of the aubergine halves. Finely chop the flesh and set aside.


Place the aubergine halves onto a baking sheet, drizzle with half the olive oil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Transfer to the oven and roast for 8-10 minutes.


Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and fry the chorizo for 2-3 minutes. Add the chopped aubergine flesh and cook for 1-2 minutes. Add the tomato and spinach and cook for another minute.


Remove from the heat, stir in the ricotta and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Remove the aubergine halves from the oven, spoon the filling mixture into the aubergine halves and place back in the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until softened and golden-brown.


To serve, place the stuffed aubergine halves onto two plates.
