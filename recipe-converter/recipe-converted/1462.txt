Whisk together all the ingredients except for the plums, honey and vegetable oil to make a thick pancake batter.


Add the plums and stir well.


Heat a small frying pan and add the vegetable oil, using a kitchen towel soaked with the oil.


Add ladlefuls of batter to the pan to make 10cm/4in rounds and cook for 2-3 minutes. They are ready to turn when small bubbles appear on the surface. Turn over and cook for a further two minutes or until golden and cooked through.
