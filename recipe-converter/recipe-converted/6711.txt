This is a light, set cream from Lucknow flavoured with saffron and rosewater – a typical sweet from the era of the Nawabs and their very inventive chefs. It is standard practice to present the nimish covered with silver leaf as well as pistachios.

Ingredients

450g/1lb double cream
50g/1¾oz icing sugar
1 tsp rosewater
pinch saffron strands, soaked in 100ml/3½fl oz warm milk for 15 minutes

To decorate

few chopped pistachios and edible silver leaf (optional)




Method


Whip the cream in a bowl until soft peaks just start to form – it’s important not to over-whisk it.


Sift in the icing sugar, then add the rosewater and the now cool saffron milk and strands. Whisk together for a minute until smooth and a few bubbles appear on the surface. Pour gently into small serving bowls or glasses and chill overnight.


Decorate with sliced pistachios, and silver leaf if you like. Serve.
