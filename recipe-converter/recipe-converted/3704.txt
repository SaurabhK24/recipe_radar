Enjoy this classic homemade Christmas tipple laced with brandy to keep out the winter cold.






By Patrick Williams






Ingredients

1140ml/2 pints whole milk
6 free-range eggs
50g/2oz caster sugar
1 vanilla pod, split
20 fresh cherries, stones removed and halved
200ml/7fl oz brandy
cocoa powder, for dusting




Method


Place the milk, eggs, sugar and vanilla pod in a medium pan and heat gently, without boiling, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.


The egg nog can be chilled at this stage or served hot.


To serve, scatter the cherries in the bottom of each serving glass. Divide the brandy between the glasses and pour the egg nog over. Dust with cocoa powder and serve.
