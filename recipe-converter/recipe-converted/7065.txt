Ingredients
For the chicken

2 organic boneless chicken breasts, skin on
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil
6 baby onions, peeled and halved
Â½ tsp caster sugar

For the potatoes

6 new potatoes, halved lengthwise
1 bunch fresh chives, finely chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the mushrooms

50g/2oz butter
200g/7oz pied de mouton mushrooms (or other wild mushrooms), cleaned and trimmed
salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 shallots, finely chopped
200ml/7fl oz single cream
12 wild garlic leaves, finely chopped




Method


Preheat the oven to 160C/320F/Gas 3.


For the chicken, season both of the chicken breasts with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then place, skin-side down, into a hot ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat. Cook until the skin is golden-brown, then add the baby onions and sugar to the pan.


Turn the chicken breasts over and transfer to the oven to cook for a further 7-8 minutes, or until the chicken is completely cooked through. Remove from the oven and leave to rest for five minutes.


For the potatoes, place the potatoes into a saucepan of water, add salt and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for ten minutes, or until tender, then drain off the liquid.


Add the chives and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and leave to stand.


For the mushrooms, heat a non-stick frying pan until hot and add the butter to the pan. When the butter is foaming, add the mushrooms, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and leave to fry for 1-2 minutes.


Add the chopped shallots and cook for a further two minutes.


Reduce the heat and add the single cream. Gently heat to bring to the boil, and, once boiling, reduce the heat and add the wild garlic leaves. Stir well and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, pour the mushroom mixture into two serving bowls and place the chicken breasts on top. Place the baby onions around the plate and serve the new potatoes on the side.
