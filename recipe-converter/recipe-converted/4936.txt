Mustard is so very easy to make and the perfect addition to a ham sandwich. It makes a great homemade gift too.






By Mari Williams






Ingredients

175g/6oz yellow mustard seeds
175g/6oz black mustard seeds
500ml/18fl oz beer or ale
1 tbsp sea salt
pinch crushed chilli flakes
175ml/6fl oz cider vinegar or white wine vinegar
6 tbsp runny honey
1 tbsp ground mace or nutmeg




Method


Mix the mustard seeds and beer together in bowl, cover and set aside overnight. (The mustard seeds will soften and soak up most of the beer.)


Sterilise the jars for the mustard. Wash in very hot water or on the hot cycle of a dishwasher. Preheat the oven to 160C/325F/Gas 3. Place the jars upside down on a baking tray and dry in the oven for 10-15 minutes.


Stir in the remaining ingredients, then blend in a food processor until nearly smooth (you may need to do this is batches).


Spoon the mustard into the sterilised jars; tap gently to remove all the air bubbles.




Recipe Tips
For the ultimate mini food hamper, try using a local beer in the mustard and wrapping an extra bottle with some local cheese.
