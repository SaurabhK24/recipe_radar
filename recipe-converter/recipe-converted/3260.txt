Method


For the crisp fried chicken, iplace the bread, garlic cloves, lemon zest and herbs in a small food processor and pulse until combined. Transfer the herb mixture to a plate.


Dust the chicken fillets in plain flour, dip in the egg and roll in the herb breadcrumbs to coat well.


Heat the olive oil in a small non-stick frying pan and fry the chicken pieces for 4-6 minutes on each side, or until cooked through.


For the sauce, heat the olive oil in a small saucepan and add the onion. Fry until the onion is soft but not coloured.


Add the garlic to the pan and cook for one minute.


Add the remaining ingredients and simmer for a further two minutes.


To serve, pour the sauce into a small dipping bowl. Place the chicken onto a serving plate and garnish with lemon wedges and parsley.
