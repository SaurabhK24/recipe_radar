Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
½ large red potato, peeled and cut into cubes
100ml/3½fl oz white wine
50ml/2fl oz chicken stock
1 vine tomato, de-seeded and chopped
100ml/3½fl oz double cream
1 fillet sea bass, cut into serving pieces
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp chopped fresh chives




Method


Heat the oil in a pan and gently fry the potato cubes for 5-7 minutes, until golden-brown. Add the white wine to the pan and boil until the liquid has reduced by half.


Pour in the stock, tomato and cream and bring to simmering point.


Gently place the fish pieces into the pan and poach for about two minutes, or until cooked through. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Gently stir in the chopped chives, taking care not to break up the fish.


Pour into a serving bowl and serve.
