Ingredients

100g/3½oz cooking chorizo, diced
200g/7oz tinned chickpeas, drained and rinsed
200g/7oz tinned chopped tomatoes
1 tbsp chopped fresh thyme leaves
salt and freshly ground black pepper

To serve

2 slices toast
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley leaves




Method


Place a saucepan over a medium heat. When the pan is hot, add the chorizo and fry for 1-2 minutes, or until starting to crisp.


Add the drained chickpeas and tinned tomatoes, then stir in the thyme. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Simmer for 4-5 minutes, or until the sauce has warmed through and thickened to your liking.


To serve, spoon the chickpea mixture on top of the toast and garnish with parsley.
