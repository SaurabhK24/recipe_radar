Ingredients

55g/2oz dark chocolate, melted
1 free-range egg yolk
3 free-range egg whites, whisked until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed
1 lemon, zest

For the crêpes

110g/4oz plain flour
75g/3oz caster sugar
2 free-range eggs
1 tbsp oil
50ml/2fl oz milk
butter, to grease




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


In a clean bowl, beat the chocolate and egg yolks together. Then fold the egg whites and lemon zest into the mixture.


For the crêpes, in a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, eggs, oil and milk to create a light batter.


Heat a crêpe pan and lightly grease with butter. Add half of the batter, swirl the mixture around the pan, to coat, and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side over a medium heat. Remove the crêpe and place on a kitchen paper, then repeat with the other half of the batter.


Place the two crêpes onto a baking sheet and fill one half of each crêpe with half of the chocolate mixture.


Fold over the other halves of the crêpes to make two half-moon shapes.Place into the oven, to bake, for five minutes, or until risen.


To serve, place the crêpes onto a plate.
