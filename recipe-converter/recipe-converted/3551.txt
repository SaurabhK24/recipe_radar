Ingredients
For the Dolcelatte risotto

25g/1oz unsalted butter
½ onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, chopped
100g/3½oz risotto rice
50ml/2fl oz white wine
300ml/10fl oz hot chicken stock (vegetarians can substitute vegetable stock)
75g/2¾oz Dolcelatte cheese
50ml/2fl oz double cream
1 tbsp chopped fresh tarragon
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tsp chopped fresh chives, to serve

For the watercress oil

1 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp watercress, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the risotto, melt the butter in a pan over a low heat and cook the onion and garlic for 3-4 minutes, until softened.


Add the rice and wine, bring to the boil and simmer until the wine is absorbed.


Gradually add the stock, a ladleful at a time, stirring well between each addition until the stock is absorbed.


When the rice is al dente and all the stock has been absorbed, stir in the cheese, cream and tarragon. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and cook for a further 2-3 minutes.


For the watercress oil, place the oil and watercress into a mini food processor. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and blend to combine.


To serve, place the risotto into bowls, sprinkle over the chives and drizzle over the watercress oil.
