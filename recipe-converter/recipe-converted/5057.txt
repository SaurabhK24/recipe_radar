Ingredients

1 tbsp wholegrain mustard
1 tsp runny honey
2 pork chops
50g/2oz butter
1 red onion, halved and sliced
2 Golden Delicious apples, peeled, cored and cut into 8 slices
200g/7oz new potatoes, lightly cooked and halved
1 tsp wholegrain mustard
6 shredded fresh sage leaves

For the sauce

3 finely chopped shallots
1 tbsp green peppercorns
small glass cider
100ml/3Â½fl oz double cream




Method


Mix the wholegrain mustard with the runny honey. Slice the back fat on the chops in three places to stop them curling, then slather liberally with the honey mustard.


Place then in a medium hot griddle pan and cook for six minutes each side.


In another pan melt a little butter and add the onions and apples and cook for two or three minutes.


Next add the potatoes and another teaspoon of mustard. The idea is to warm everything together. Just before serving add the sage and season.


Make the peppercorn sauce. In a hot pan place a knob of butter and allow it to foam.


Add the shallots and peppercorns and cook for a minute. Add a splash of cider and bring to the boil.


Add the double cream and cook until it thickens and colours. Season.


To serve, place the chop on the plate, pile apple and potatoes around and spoon over the sauce.
