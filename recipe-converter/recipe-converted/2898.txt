Stewed nectarines, pears and apple covered with a delicious toasted oat and nut topping. Far too good for the compost heap!






By Nigel Slater


From Nigel Slater's Dish of the Day






Ingredients

2 pears
1 apple
2 nectarines
½ lemon, juice only
1 banana, roughly chopped into discs
3 tbsp golden caster sugar

For the crumble topping

200g/7oz plain flour
100g/3½oz butter
60g/2¼oz rolled oats
1 large handful pumpkin seeds
30g/1oz flaked almonds
2 tbsp sesame seeds
4 tbsp demerara sugar

To serve

cream or custard




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Chop the pears, apple and nectarines and place in a pan over a low heat with the lemon juice. Warm through for 10 minutes.


For the crumble topping, in a bowl, rub together the flour and butter with your hands until it resembles breadcrumbs. Add the remaining dry ingredients and the demarara sugar. Set aside.


Take a small roasting tin. Layer the warm fruit on the bottom, along with the chopped banana. Sprinkle with the golden caster sugar.


Top with the crumble mixture and bake for 20-30 minutes, or until the topping is golden-brown. Serve immediately with cream or custard.




Recipe Tips
The nectarines and pears are a lovely combination but you can substitute them for any fruit you have to hand.

  If your fruit is underripe, you may need to add a little extra sugar.
