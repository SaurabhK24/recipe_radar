Ingredients

vegetable oil, for frying
1 small red onion, peeled, finely sliced
1 small aubergine, trimmed, diced into 2cm/¾in cubes
1 tbsp garam masala
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp coriander seeds
150g/5oz okra
150g/5oz cauliflower florets
75g/3oz frozen peas
1 tsp ground turmeric
50g/2oz dried coconut, grated
½ vegetable stock cube, dissolved in 200ml/7fl oz water
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Heat two tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large lidded saucepan over a medium heat. Add the red onion, aubergine and garam masala and fry until starting to brown, about 8-10 minutes.


Dry fry the cumin and coriander seeds in a small frying pan until fragrant, then add to the onion mixture and stir well.


Add the remaining ingredients, stirring well to combine, then cover the pan with a lid.


Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the cauliflower florets are tender. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
