Ingredients

500ml/18 fl oz full fat milk
1 onion, halved and studded with 2 cloves
1 bay leaf
½ tsp black peppercorns
4 x 175g/6oz salmon fillet, skin on
50g/1¾oz butter
25g/1oz plain flour
50ml/2 fl oz double cream
4 tbsp flat leaf parsley, finely chopped
3 lemons
1 leek, finely diced
Salt and pepper




Method


In a saucepan over a medium heat, bring the milk, studded onion, bay leaf and peppercorns to a simmer.


Add the salmon to the pan, and bring back up to a simmer and poach the salmon for 10 minutes.


Remove the salmon from the milk and set aside, and strain the milk into a bowl.


In a separate saucepan melt half the butter over a medium heat, then stir in the flour and cook for a few minutes until light golden-brown.


Whisk in the reserved milk and bring to a simmer, whisking all the time until the sauce has thickened.


Whisk in the double cream and parsley.


Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt, black pepper and lemon juice.


Heat a frying pan until medium hot add the last of the butter and the leeks and sweat for 4-5 minutes until just softened.


Season with salt and black pepper.


To serve, spoon the diced leeks into the centre of the plate. Top with a piece of poached salmon then spoon the parsley sauce over. Halve the remaining lemons and wrap in clean muslin, then tie with a piece of string and serve alongside.
