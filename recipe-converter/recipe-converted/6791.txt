I’m almost embarrassed at how easy this is but, as you will find out, simple though it is to make, its flavour is deep, complex and utterly compelling.






By Nigella Lawson


From Nigellissima






Ingredients

300ml/10fl oz double cream
175g/6oz condensed milk
2 tbsp instant espresso powder
2 tbsp espresso liqueur (or coffee liqueur)




Method


Whisk all the ingredients together until soft peaks form, and you have a gorgeous, caffè-latte-coloured airy mixture, and then fill an airtight container and freeze for six hours or overnight.




Recipe Tips
I have never tried using regular instant coffee granules in place of the instant espresso powder stipulated, though I dare say if you boosted quantities and dissolved the granules in a little boiling water first, you could make it work for you.
