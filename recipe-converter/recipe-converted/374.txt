For me this is the ultimate cuppa. It is what women across India make whenever they have friends coming over for a break or a chat. It offers solace and comfort and is invigorating and relaxing all at the same time.

Ingredients

350ml/12fl oz water
100ml/3½fl oz milk
4 black peppercorns
10 green cardamom pods, lightly crushed
good pinch green fennel seeds
small piece cinnamon stick
1 tsp fresh ginger, peeled and roughly sliced
1 black tea bag
sugar, to taste
salt, to taste (optional)




Method


Heat the water and milk in a pan with the spices and ginger until it comes to the boil. Turn the heat down and cook over a low to medium heat for 15 minutes. Be careful as the milk can easily rise and boil over.


Once the volume is reduced to a large cupful, add the teabag and let it brew for one minute, or longer if you like strong tea.


To serve, strain into a cup and add sugar or salt if using, to taste.
