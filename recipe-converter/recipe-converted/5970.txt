Want to know the secret to roast potatoes with a lower calorie count? Use cooking oil spray and a very hot oven. It gives the potatoes a crunch with much less fat than the usual recipe.

Ingredients

1.2kg/2lb 12oz floury potatoes, such as King Edward, peeled, cut into chunks
cooking oil spray
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 230C/210C Fan/Gas 8 or its hottest setting.


Boil the potatoes in lightly salted boiling water for 3-4 minutes, then drain in a colander. Fluff up the edges using a fork, then season with salt and pepper, spray well with cooking oil spray.


Tip the potatoes into a large baking tray and roast for 25 minutes. Mix them around, spray with more cooking oil spray and roast for a further 25 minutes, until golden-brown all over.
