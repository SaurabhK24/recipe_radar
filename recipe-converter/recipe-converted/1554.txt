Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
750g/1lb 10oz aubergines, cut into 1cm/1½in chunks
1 large onion, cut into 1cm/1½in chunks
3 celery sticks, roughly chopped
2 large beef tomatoes, skinned and deseeded
1 tsp chopped thyme
¼-½ tsp cayenne pepper
2 tbsp capers, drained
small handful pitted green olives
4 tbsp white wine vinegar
1 tbsp sugar
1-2 tbsp cocoa powder (optional)
freshly ground black pepper
To garnish
chopped almonds, toasted
chopped parsley




Method


Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan until very hot, add the aubergine and fry for about 15 minutes, or until very soft. Add a little boiling water to prevent sticking if necessary.


Meanwhile, place the onion and celery in a large saucepan with a little water. Cook for 5 minutes, or until tender but still firm.


Add the tomatoes, thyme, cayenne pepper and aubergine to the saucepan. Cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the capers, olives, vinegar, sugar and cocoa powder and cook for 2-3 minutes.


Season with freshly ground black pepper. Divide between 6 bowls, garnish with the toasted almonds and parsley and serve.




Recipe Tips
If you don't fancy aubergines you can use courgettes. Just add the courgettes at the same time as the tomatoes.
