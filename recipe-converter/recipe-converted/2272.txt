This tasty stuffing is free from wheat, gluten, dairy, soya and egg. It's also a doddle to make.





By Michelle Berriedale-Johnson






Ingredients

100g/3½oz unsweetened chestnut purée or whole tinned chestnuts
4 tbsp olive, sunflower, hazelnut or walnut oil
2 tbsp medium sweet sherry, marsala or port
100g/3½oz tinned chickpeas
2 tbsp sunflower seeds
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Purée the chestnuts or chestnut purée in a food processor with the oil of your choice and the sherry, marsala or port until it is smooth.


Add the chickpeas and purée briefly if you want to keep some 'crunchiness' in the chickpeas; if you want a totally smooth stuffing it does not matter how vigorously you purée them.


Remove from the processor. Add sunflower seeds and season to taste.


You can use the stuffing inside a turkey, bake it in little balls alongside the bird, or use it as a pâté on toast.
