Ingredients

400g/14¼oz fillet steak, cut into 6 medallions
600g/1lb 5oz Italian tinned chopped tomato
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
90ml/3¼fl oz olive oil
1 mozzarella ball, drained and finely sliced
pinch of dry oregano
6 slices of ciabatta bread, toasted
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


In a hot griddle pan, sear the steak on both sides (approximately two minutes per side for medium rare).


In a separate frying pan (30cm/12in diameter) fry the garlic in the olive oil until golden. Add in the tomatoes, season with salt, pepper and oregano.


Add the cooked steak to the sauce and continue to cook for approximately three minutes until some of the water from the tomatoes has evaporated.


On the same griddle pan that you cooked the steak on, grill the ciabatta.


Place three slices of ciabatta in a triangle on a plate. Then place three medallions in the middle.


Cover with a few slices of the mozzarella and then pour on some of the pizza sauce. Serve immediately.
