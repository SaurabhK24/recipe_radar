Ingredients

150g/5½oz sirloin steak
1 tsp olive oil, for frying
salt and freshly ground black pepper
½ onion, thinly sliced
4 button mushrooms, thinly sliced
½ green pepper, thinly sliced
25g/1oz semi-soft cheese (such as port salut, taleggio or brie)
1 panini roll or demi-baguette, lightly toasted




Method


Rub the steak with a little oil, salt and black pepper. Heat a frying pan until it is smoking hot, then fry the steak until well-browned on both sides. Reduce the heat and cook, turning frequently, until it is cooked to your liking. Set the steak aside to rest.


In the same pan, over a medium heat, fry the sliced onions in a little more oil with a pinch of salt. Stir them frequently and cook for 5 minutes until they are softened and golden-brown. Add the mushrooms and the green pepper and fry for another 5 minutes. The green pepper should still have a little bite.


Slice the steak thinly into strips and pile onto the roll or baguette. Top with the slices of cheese and the fried vegetables. Serve with some salad leaves or even some chips from round the corner.




Recipe Tips
Sirloin is expensive, but you can always buy a little at a butcher’s. Rump steak also works well.
