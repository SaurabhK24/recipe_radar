Ingredients
For the peaches

55g/2oz butter
3 tbsp brown sugar
4 canned peach halves, drained
2 tbsp double cream

For the toast

2 free-range eggs
150ml/5fl oz double cream
2 tbsp caster sugar
1 thick slice white bread

To serve

2 tbsp double cream




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the peaches, melt the butter and sugar in a frying pan and add the peach halves. Cook for 4-5 minutes, turning once, or until the peaches are caramelised. Remove the peaches from the pan, then stir in the cream to make a butterscotch sauce.


For the toast, whisk together the eggs, cream and sugar until smooth and creamy and soak the slice of bread in the mixture. Place the bread onto a baking tray and bake in the oven for 6-7 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp.


Serve the peach halves on top of the toast, with the butterscotch sauce spooned over the top and a drizzle of cream.
