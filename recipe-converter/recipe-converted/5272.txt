Ingredients
For the truffle

125g/4½oz dark chocolate
125g/4½oz milk chocolate
250g/8¾oz whipping cream
1 tsp brandy
¼ tsp instant coffee

For the bubble wrap garnish

25g/1oz dark chocolate
25g/1oz white chocolate
1 piece of clean bubble wrap

For the raspberry sauce

1 punnet of raspberries
2 tsp icing sugar




Method


To make the truffle, place chocolate in a bowl over a pan of simmering hot water until it slowly melts. Alternatively, place in a plastic bowl and melt in the microwave for 4-5 minutes on the defrost setting.


Half whip the cream in a large bowl, then warm the brandy in a pan, add the coffee and mix until smooth.


Finally fold together the chocolate, coffee mix and cream and spoon into ramekins.


Chill for at least 2-3 hours.


To make the chocolate 'bubble wrap', melt the dark and white chocolate separately then fold together slightly to create a marbled effect.


With a pallete knife, spread the marbled chocolate over a sheet of clean, plastic bubble wrap and set in the fridge for an hour.


After chilling, gently peel the chocolate of the bubble wrap and break into chunks (discard the plastic). You will be left with chocolate that looks like bubble wrap.


For the raspberry sauce, blend the raspberries and icing sugar in a liquidiser, pass through a sieve and put into a sauce bottle.


Zigzag raspberry sauce on a serving plate, centre the chocolate on the plate and top with chocolate bubble wrap.
