Ingredients

250g/9oz butter or margarine
250g/9oz golden syrup
125g/4½oz black treacle
500g/1lb 2oz muscavado sugar
375g/13oz plain flour
1½ tsp ground ginger
½ tsp baking powder
500g/1lb 2oz oatmeal
½ pint milk




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Line a 15x20cm/6x8in baking tin with greaseproof paper.


In a pan, gently melt the butter (or margarine), golden syrup, black treacle and sugar until combined.


Mix the remaining dry ingredients together in a large bowl.


Add the hot syrup mixture and stir to combine. Add the milk to help loosen the mixture.


Pour into the prepared tin and bake for 35-45 minutes, or until springy to the touch.
