Ingredients
For the pineapple

100g/3½oz caster sugar
1 vanilla pod, split and seeds scraped out
1 cardamom pod, crushed
1 tsp ground cinnamon
½ pineapple, peeled, cored and sliced
½ lime, juice only

For the sabayon

3 free-range egg yolks
4 tbsp white wine
55g/2oz caster sugar




Method


For the caramelised spiced pineapple, heat the sugar, the vanilla and cardamom seeds and the cinnamon in a non-stick frying pan until the sugar is melted and caramelised.


Add the pineapple and lime juice and stir. Remove from the heat and place onto a serving plate along with the pan juices.


For the sabayon, place the egg yolks, wine and sugar into a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water and whisk continuously until the mixture is thick and frothy.


To serve, drizzle the sabayon over the pineapple.
