Ingredients
For the honey roasted carrots

150g/5½oz small carrots, halved and blanched for two minutes
15g/½oz butter
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 tsp honey
2 tsp soy sauce

For the dressing

1 tbsp red wine
2 tsp red wine vinegar
2 tbsp olive oil
50g/1¾oz Stilton
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Place the blanched carrots onto a baking sheet. Add the butter and oil and mix well to coat the carrots. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper and place in the oven to roast for 5-10 minutes.


Remove the carrots from the oven, drizzle over the honey and the soy sauce and return to the oven to cook for another 2-4 minutes, until golden-brown.


To make the dressing, place all of the ingredients except the chives into a bowl and mix together.


To serve, place the carrots into a serving dish, pour over the dressing and garnish with chopped chives.
