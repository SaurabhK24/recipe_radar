Ingredients
For the sea bass

4 x 150g/5oz sea bass fillets
1 tsp olive oil
salt
pinch freshly ground white pepper
pinch ground coriander

For the fennel pesto

1 fennel bulb, roughly chopped
2 tbsp chopped fresh dill
50g/2oz pine nuts, toasted
2 tbsp ground almonds
50g/2oz parmesan, freshly grated
100ml/3½fl oz olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the tomato salsa

150g/5oz cherry tomatoes, cut in half
½ lemon, juice only
2 tbsp sesame oil
2 dashes Tabasco sauce
2 tbsp fresh coriander leaves
1 punnet pea shoots




Method


Using a sharp knife, trim the sea bass fillets into a square shape, then cut into the skin side to lightly score.


Rub the fillets with olive oil and season with salt and a pinch of white pepper and ground coriander.


Heat a frying pan until hot and add the sea bass, skin-side down. Fry for three minutes, then turn and cook for a further 1-2 minutes, or until completely cooked through.


For the fennel pesto, place the fennel into a food processor and blend to a fine purée.


Add the dill, pine nuts, ground almonds and parmesan and pulse to combine.


Add the olive oil and blend to a porridge-like consistency. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


For the tomato salsa, place the tomatoes into a bowl and add the lemon juice, sesame oil, Tabasco sauce and coriander leaves. Stir gently to combine.


To serve, place a spoonful of fennel pesto into the centre of each plate. Place a sea bass fillet on top of each and spoon the salsa around. Garnish with a few pea shoots and serve.
