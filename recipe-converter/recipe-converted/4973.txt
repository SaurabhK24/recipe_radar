Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
¼ onion, finely chopped
¼ tsp coriander seeds
¼ tsp cumin seeds
pinch chilli flakes
pinch ground ginger
2 tomatoes, skinned, deseeded and finely chopped




Method


Heat the olive oil in a small frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onions and fry for 2-3 minutes, until softened.


Place the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, chilli flakes and ginger into a pestle and mortar and grind to a powder.


Add the ground spices and chilli flakes and tomatoes to the onions and simmer gently over a low heat for 10 minutes, or until the tomato has softened and become a sauce.


To serve, pour into a bowl and leave to cool.
