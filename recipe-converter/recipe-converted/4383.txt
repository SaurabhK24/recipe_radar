This superbly light sponge cake makes a wonderful afternoon treat with a cuppa, or try it as a dessert served with lashings of cream.

Ingredients
For the génoise sponge

250g/9oz caster sugar
8 medium free-range eggs
250g/9oz plain flour
50g/1¾oz butter, melted

For the blueberry compôte and vanilla cream

250g/9oz blueberries
100g/3½oz caster sugar
500ml/18fl oz double cream
1 vanilla pod, cut in half lengthways and seeds scraped out
icing sugar, for dusting




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease and line two 22cm/9in round cake tins.


For the génoise sponge, place the sugar and eggs in a large bowl and whisk until thick and pale.


Fold in the flour and melted butter and divide between the prepared cake tins.


Bake in the oven for 20-30 minutes, or until the cakes are risen and springy to the touch. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. When cool enough to handle, turn out on to a wire rack to cool completely.


For the blueberry compôte and vanilla cream, place the blueberries, sugar and four tablespoons of water in a small saucepan. Place over a medium heat and simmer for five minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool and thicken.


Place the cream in a large bowl and add the vanilla seeds. Whisk until thick.


To serve, spread the cooled compôte over the top of one cake and top with the whipped cream. Place the other cake on top and dust with icing sugar.
