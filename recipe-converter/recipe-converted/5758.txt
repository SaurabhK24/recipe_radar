Ingredients

150g/5½oz bulgar wheat
½ vegetable stock cube
boiling water
1 lemon, zest and juice
2 tbsp chopped fresh rosemary
2 tbsp olive oil
3 spring onions, sliced
handful mixed salad leaves, to garnish




Method


Place the bulgar wheat into a small pan and crumble the stock cube over it.


Add boiling water to reach 1cm/½in above the bulgar wheat and stock. Cover with a lid and simmer over a medium heat for 12-15 minutes, or until the bulgar wheat is tender and has absorbed the water.


Fluff the wheat with a fork and add the remaining ingredients, mixing well until combined.


Press the bulgar wheat salad into a small heatproof bowl so that the wheat moulds to the bowl, and cover with a plate.


To serve, turn out the salad onto the serving plate and garnish with the mixed salad leaves.
