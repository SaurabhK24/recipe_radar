Ingredients
For the fritters

1 ear sweetcorn, kernels removed with a sharp knife
2 free-range eggs, beaten
2 tbsp plain flour
2 tbsp milk
salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
2 tbsp olive oil

For the salsa

1 ear sweetcorn, kernels removed with a sharp knife
1 tomato, deseeded and chopped
¼ red onion, finely chopped
1 lime, juice only
3 tbsp chopped fresh coriander




Method


For the fritters, place all of the fritter ingredients except the oil in a bowl and mix well.


Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and fry spoonfuls of the batter for 2-3 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown and crisp. Drain on kitchen paper.


For the salsa, mix together all of the salsa ingredients in a small bowl.


To serve, place the bowl of salsa in the middle of a serving plate and arrange the fritters around.
