Ingredients

800g/1lb 12oz ripe strawberries, hulled
splash kirsch
1-2 tbsp icing sugar, to taste
200ml/7fl oz double cream
200ml/7fl oz crème fraîche or thick Greek-style yoghurt
6 ready-made meringue shells
2 passion fruit, pulp only




Method


Cut the larger strawberries into halves or quarters.


Set aside a quarter of the strawberries for garnish and place the rest into a large bowl.


Add a splash of kirsch and 1-2 tablespoons of icing sugar to taste.


Lightly mash the strawberries with a large fork or a potato masher. Cover with cling film and place into the fridge to chill for an hour.


Whip the cream lightly and fold in the crème fraîche or yoghurt.


Using your hands, roughly crush the meringues into bite-sized pieces over the bowl of cream mixture, then gently fold through the mixture.


Fold in the crushed strawberries and passion fruit pulp, to create a rippled effect.


Spoon the cream and meringue mixture into clear serving glasses and garnish with the reserved strawberries.
