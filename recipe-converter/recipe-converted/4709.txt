Chicken thighs are more flavourful than breasts and a lot cheaper, perfect if you're solo cooking on a budget.

Ingredients
For the chicken

1 tbsp sesame oil
1 tbsp honey
1 tbsp soy sauce
100g/3½oz chicken thigh meat, scored with a sharp knife

For the stir-fry

1 tbsp olive oil
1 garlic clove, thinly sliced
¼ leek, sliced into long thin strips
¼ red pepper, sliced into long thin strips




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.


For the chicken, mix the sesame oil, honey and soy sauce together in a large bowl. Cover the chicken in the marinade and leave for 5 minutes.


Heat a frying pan until hot. Remove the chicken from the marinade, reserve the marinade mixture. Fry the chicken for 2-3 minutes on each side. Transfer the chicken to the oven and roast for 5 minutes, or until cooked through.


To make the stir-fry, heat the oil in a small frying pan. Add the garlic, leeks and pepper and cook until soft. Pour in the marinade mixture and bring to a simmer, continue to cook until the mixture is thick.


Spoon the stir fried vegetables into the centre of a plate, put the chicken on top and serve.




Recipe Tips
You may not think of honey as a store cupboard ingredient but it is great for helping to get a sweet and sour balance in Asian cooking.
