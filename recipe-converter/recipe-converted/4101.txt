There are only two steps to this chutney recipe - in half an hour it's ready to eat with bread, cheese or ham. Great news if you have a glut of plums.



Ingredients

450g/1lb red plums, halved and stoned
180g/6oz caster sugar
120ml/4fl oz cider vinegar
1 cinnamon stick
2 star anise




Method


Put all the ingredients into a pan and heat gently until the sugar dissolves. Bring to the boil and simmer gently for about 20-30 minutes until the plums are tender and the liquid is syrupy. Cool and keep in the fridge.


Serve with cheeses or ham.
