Give your Christmas presents the personal touch by making homemade oatcakes for loved ones â€“ wrap them up with a selection of cheeses.

Ingredients

110g/4oz medium oatmeal, plus more for dusting
110g/4oz plain flour
55g/2oz lard, dripping or poultry fat
1 level tsp salt
cold water

For the glaze

1 egg
1 tbsp milk
1 tsp sugar




Method


Mix the oatmeal and flour in a bowl. Rub in the fat, add the salt and mix in just enough cold to form a soft but not tacky dough.


Roll out the dough on an oatmeal-strewn board. Cut out circles with a scone cutter. Alternatively, cut out a dinner-plate round, and quarter it.


Mix together the egg, milk and sugar to form a glaze.


Cook the oatcakes on an ungreased medium-hot griddle, without turning them. The moment the first batch are in place, brush them over with glaze - it will turn to a shiny coating as they cook.


When fully cooked, remove. Store in an airtight box.
