Ingredients

1 pheasant, carcass only
Â¼ onion, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, peeled
1 sprig fresh thyme
few black peppercorns
1 tbsp chopped fresh flatleaf parsley, to serve
salt, to taste




Method


Using a large, sharp knife or poultry shears, roughly chop the pheasant carcass.


Place the carcass pieces into a large pan with the onion, garlic, thyme and peppercorns. Cover with cold water and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the broth is well flavoured.


Strain the broth through a sieve into a warm serving bowl. Pick off any meat from the bones, add to the broth, and discard the bones.


Season the broth with salt, to taste.


Garnish with the chopped parsley and serve.
