This modern version of the retro classic is cooked in the oven instead of steamed.





By Katharine Reeve






Ingredients

150g/5½oz self-raising flour, sifted
75g/3oz vegetable suet
100ml/3½fl oz cold water
pinch salt
5 tbsp plum jam (or raspberry, damson)




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Mix the sifted flour, suet, and salt together in a large bowl. Add enough water to make a soft dough, but not sticky.


Knead lightly on a lightly floured board for a few minutes before rolling out to a 1cm/½in thickness and a rough 20cm/8in square shape.


Spread a thick layer of jam over one side of the dough, leaving 1cm/½in border, which you dampen with a little water.


Roll up loosely, pinching the ends together as you go to stop the jam escaping. Place the roll on a large lightly buttered piece of silicon baking parchment, sealed edge down.


Join the ends of the paper and make a pleated join along the top to allow for the pudding to expand, then twist the ends like a sweet wrapper.


Put the pudding into a large loaf tin or a brownie tin. Fill a roasting tin with boiling water and place on the base of the oven. Then put your roly poly on the top rack for 35-40 minutes.


Serve a single thick slice, with homemade custard.
