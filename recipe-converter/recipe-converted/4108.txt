Ingredients
For the fresh tagliatelle

200g/7oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting
2 very large free-range eggs
pinch sea salt

For the tomato sauce

2 tbsp olive oil
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 x 400g/14oz can cherry tomatoes
½ tsp dried chilli flakes
salt and freshly ground black pepper
75g/2¾oz Wensleydale cheese with cranberries
small bunch fresh basil, torn
2 tbsp chopped fresh flatleaf parsley

To serve

5 fresh basil leaves, torn




Method


For the pasta, combine the flour, eggs and salt in a food processor, adding more flour if needed or a drop of water if the mixture is too dry. Pulse until the mixture comes together as a dough. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic.


Cut the ball of dough in half and feed one half through a pasta machine. Repeat this 5-6 times, decreasing the thickness of the pasta at each stage. Repeat with the other half of the pasta dough.


Drape the pasta sheets over a wooden spoon or the back of a chair and allow them to dry for about five minutes. Meanwhile, attach the tagliatelle cutter attachment to your pasta machine.


Feed the sheets through the pasta machine, gathering up the strips as they come out and forming loose 'nests' on a floured surface.


For the tomato sauce, heat the olive oil in a pan and gently fry the garlic for one minute.


Add the tomatoes and chilli flakes, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and cook for 8-10 minutes, until the sauce is slightly reduced. Crumble in the cheese and mix through to melt. Stir in the basil and parsley.


Cook the pasta in a large saucepan of salted boiling water for about two minutes, or until al dente. Drain and return to the pan, then stir in the sauce.


Serve the pasta in shallow bowls, garnished with fresh basil.
