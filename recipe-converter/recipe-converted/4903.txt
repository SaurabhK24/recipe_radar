Ingredients

8 free-range large eggs
2 spring onions, thinly sliced
2 tbsp chopped chives
2 tbsp chopped chervil
20g/¾oz butter
4 thin slices of smoked salmon, cut into thin strips, or 125g/4½oz smoked salmon trimmings
100g/3½oz salad leaves
freshly ground black pepper




Method


Put the eggs, spring onions and herbs in a bowl, beat together lightly and season with freshly ground black pepper.


Heat a medium-sized frying pan over a medium-low heat, add a quarter of the butter and melt until beginning to foam. Pour in a quarter of the egg mixture and swirl to cover the base of the pan. Stir gently for 2-3 minutes or until almost set.


Sprinkle over a quarter of the smoked salmon strips and cook for a further 30 seconds, or until just set. Fold over and slide on to a serving plate. Repeat to make 3 more omelettes. Serve each omelette with salad leaves.
