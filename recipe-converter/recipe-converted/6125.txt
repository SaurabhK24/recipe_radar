Ingredients
For the marinated beef

100g/3½oz rump steak, cut into thin slices
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tsp sesame oil
½ lime, zest and juice
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil

For the egg-fried rice

1 tbsp vegetable oil
2 free-range eggs, beaten
100g/3½oz long grain rice, cooked according to packet instructions
35g/1¼oz fresh or frozen (defrosted) peas
1 tsp sesame oil
1 tbsp soy sauce, to serve




Method


For the marinated beef, place the beef into a bowl along with the soy sauce, sesame oil and lime zest and juice and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Leave to marinate for at least five minutes, ideally 30 minutes.


Heat the olive oil in a frying pan over a high heat, place the marinated beef into the pan and stir fry for 2-3 minutes, or until cooked to your liking. Remove from the heat and set aside in a warm place.


For the egg-fried rice, heat the vegetable oil in a wok, add the beaten eggs and stir well to cook the eggs quickly.


Add the cooked rice, peas and sesame oil to the wok, stir well and cook for 2-3 minutes.


To serve, transfer the rice to a bowl, top with the beef and drizzle over the soy sauce.
