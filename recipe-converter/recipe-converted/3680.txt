This starter is simple and quick to make and is absolutely delicious on toast with a spot of spicy chutney.






By Mike Robinson






Ingredients

450g/1lb chicken livers, trimmed
200g/7oz butter, melted
50ml/2fl oz double cream
1 tbsp Armagnac or brandy
coarse sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

To garnish

handful of dried cranberries
8 fresh bay leaves

To serve

hot toast
spicy chutney




Method


Heat a heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat. Pour a little of the melted butter into the hot pan, add half the chicken livers and cook for three minutes. The livers should be cooked on the outside and pink in the middle. Transfer them to a plate and repeat with the rest of the livers.


Transfer the chicken livers to a food processor and blend them for a minute or so until smooth. Then pour in the remaining melted butter and double cream and blend once more. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and then stir in the Armagnac.


Transfer the pâté to eight small ramekins, cover with cling film and chill.


When you are ready to serve, uncover the pâtés and garnish with dried cranberries and fresh bay leaves to give them a festive feel. Serve with hot toast and spicy chutney.
