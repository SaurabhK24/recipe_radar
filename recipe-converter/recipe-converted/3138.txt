Ingredients

500g/1lb frozen peas
½ potato, chopped
200ml/7fl oz hot vegetable stock
150g/5½oz Stilton, crumbled
black pepper
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives
olive oil, to drizzle




Method


Place the peas, potato and stock into a small saucepan over a medium heat and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 6-8 minutes, or until the potato is soft.


Add the Stilton and stir until melted, then season with freshly ground black pepper (no salt should be required, as the Stilton will make it salty enough).


Blend with a hand blender until smooth, then pour into a bowl and garnish with chopped chives and a drizzle of olive oil.
