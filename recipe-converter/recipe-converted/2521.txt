These are the ultimate gourmet cookies: crisp on the outside, chewy and soft on the inside, and really simple to make.






By Antony Worrall Thompson


From Saturday Brunch






Ingredients

350g/12¼oz unsifted flour
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
1 tsp salt
225g/8oz butter
175g/6¼oz caster sugar
175g/6¼oz soft brown sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 eggs
350g/12¼oz dark chocolate, crumbled




Method


Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.


In a bowl, combine the flour, baking soda and salt.


In another bowl, combine the butter, sugar, brown sugar and vanilla extract until creamy. Beat in the eggs. Gradually beat in the flour mixture. Stir in the chocolate.


Split the pliable dough into two halves, rolling each out into sausage shapes, approximately 5cm/2in in diameter. Wrap them in cling film and transfer to the refrigerator until ready to use.


When you are ready to bake the cookies, simply cut the log into slices 2cm/¾in thick and lay on a baking tray, widely spaced apart. Bake for 9-11 minutes.


Serve.
