Ingredients

2 slices white crusty bread
olive oil
100g/3½oz goats' cheese
2 tbsp runny honey
2 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only
handful each fresh chervil, mint, basil
2 tsp balsamic vinegar




Method


Cut out two 5cm/2in circles of bread using a pastry cutter. Drizzle each with a little olive oil. Heat a griddle pan and griddle for two minutes on each side, or until golden.


Preheat the grill to medium. Place the griddled bread onto a baking sheet, top with the goats' cheese, honey and thyme leaves and place under the grill for 3-4 minutes.


Place the herbs into a large bowl, add a splash of olive oil and the balsamic vinegar and mix to coat the leaves.


To serve, place a pile of herb salad onto a serving plate and top with the goats' cheese crostini.
