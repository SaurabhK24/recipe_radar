Ingredients

30g/1oz butter
1 tbsp olive oil
½ onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, chopped
100g/3½oz sweet potato, chopped
1 leek, finely sliced
200ml/7fl oz hot chicken stock (vegetarians can substitute vegetable stock)
6 tbsp double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper
small handful fresh chives, chopped, to serve




Method


Heat the butter and oil in a saucepan and gently fry the onion until softened but not coloured.


Add the garlic, sweet potato and leek and sauté for 3-4 minutes, until slightly softened.


Add the stock and bring the boil. Reduce the heat, add the double cream and simmer for 2-3 minutes, or until the soup thickens slightly. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Remove from the heat and allow to cool completely. Place into the fridge to chill.


To serve, pour the soup into bowls and garnish with the chives.
