This isn’t my granny’s cake, but the granny of a former neighbour. It’s another recipe from my mum’s repertoire and I get one of these made for me every Christmas and birthday.

Ingredients

450g/1lb self-raising flour
125g/4oz caster sugar
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp mixed spice

450g/1lb mixed fruit and peel
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
250ml/9fl oz milk




Method


Preheat the oven to gas 150C/300F/Gas 2. Grease and line a 1.4kg/3lb loaf tin.

Stir the bicarbonate of soda into the milk then add to the mix and stir until well combined.

Allow to cool a little and then turn out. Serve in slices with plenty of butter.
