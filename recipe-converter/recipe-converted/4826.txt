Ingredients

6 medium roasting potatoes
3 tbsp butter, melted
lemon-pepper and salt to taste
large handful parmesan cheese (or a similar vegetarian hard cheese), grated
2 tbsp dry breadcrumbs




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/430F/Gas 7.


Either peel the potatoes or leave the peel on and scrub well.


Make small slices ¾ of the way through each potato, all along it (if the potato is placed in a large spoon the edges of the spoon will prevent you from slicing clear through the potato).


Place potatoes in a greased baking dish. Brush surface of the potato with melted butter, sprinkle with salt and pepper.


Bake in the oven for 45 minutes.


Remove from the oven and sprinkle with parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs.


Return to the oven and continue baking for 15 minutes or until potatoes are tender and crust is slightly browned. Serve immediately.
