Ingredients

½ mango, stone removed
20ml/1½ tbsp clear honey
¼ tsp dried chilli flakes
15g/¼oz butter




Method


Preheat the grill to its highest setting.


Cut into the mango flesh in a criss-cross fashion with a sharp knife, then push the skin inside out, to expose the maximum mango flesh.


Drizzle with the honey and sprinkle over the chilli flakes.


Melt the butter in an ovenproof frying pan and add the mango to the pan, flesh side down. Cook for two minutes, then turn over. Transfer to the grill and cook for a further 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown.
