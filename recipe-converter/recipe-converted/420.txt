Ingredients

100g/3Â½oz plain flour
2 free-range eggs
2 tbsp double cream
5 tbsp milk
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil
4 Polish Kabanos sausages




Method


Place the flour, eggs, cream and milk into a bowl. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix well to make a batter the consistency of double cream.


Heat the olive oil in a small non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and place the sausages into the pan. Pour over the batter and cook for 6-8 minutes, or until the batter has set.


To serve, cut the toad-in-the-hole into wedges and place onto small plates.
