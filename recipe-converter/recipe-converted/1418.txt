These easy patties have a Persian feel with the gentle spices and fresh herbs. Sabrina serves hers on sticks for a fun party snack, but you could put them in wraps, or a mezze-style platter.

Ingredients
For the bulgur wheat balls

200g/7oz bulgur wheat
2 medium free-range eggs
1 small red onion, finely chopped
2 heaped tsp turmeric
2 heaped tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp cayenne pepper
20g/½oz fresh coriander, chopped
80g/3oz dried cranberries
salt and pepper, to taste
4 tbsp olive oil

To serve

200g/7oz Greek yoghurt
150g/5½oz sweet tamarind sauce
25g/1oz nigella seeds
4 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped




Method


Cook the bulgur wheat for a little longer than the packet instructions say, so it’s very puffy (about 20 minutes). Rinse under cold water to remove the starch and leave to drain until cool enough to handle.


Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.


Mix all the ingredients, except the oil, for the bulgur wheat balls together. Squeeze the mixture using your hands so it sticks together. Shape the mixture into golf-ball sized balls or patties, don't worry about making them into perfect balls. Place in the fridge for 30 minutes.


Heat a large frying pan and add the oil, once hot add the balls and fry or 3-4 minutes. Finish them in the oven for 5-10 minutes if you like.


Serve on sticks with a drizzle of Greek style yoghurt, sweet tamarind sauce, a sprinkle of nigella seeds and more fresh coriander.
