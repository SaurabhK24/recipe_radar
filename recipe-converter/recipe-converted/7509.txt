By Gizzi Erskine






Ingredients

2 tsp olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 red chilli, seeds removed, finely chopped
400g tin chopped tomatoes
splash red wine vinegar
1 tbsp tomato purée
Tabasco sauce, to taste
1 tsp sugar
small bunch fresh basil leaves, torn
125g ball fresh buffalo mozzarella, crumbled
400g/14oz dried penne pasta, cooked according to packet instructions, drained
grated Parmesan, to serve
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Heat the oil in a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the onion and fry for 4-5 minutes, or until softened and beginning to colour. Add the garlic and chilli and continue to fry for 1-2 minutes.


Pour in the chopped tomatoes, red wine vinegar, tomato purée, a splash or two of Tabasco (to taste), sugar and half of the basil leaves, and stir well. Season with salt and pepper.


Bring the mixture to a simmer, then continue to simmer until the sauce has thickened and reduced in volume.


Just before serving, stir the crumbled mozzarella into the tomato sauce. Then stir the drained pasta into the sauce.


Divide the pasta and sauce equally among four serving plates. Sprinkle over the remaining basil leaves and the grated Parmesan.
