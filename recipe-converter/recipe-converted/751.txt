Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


To make the pastry, place the flour and butter in a food processor and blend together until you get a mixture resembling coarse breadcrumbs.


Add one egg and the water and whiz until the pastry comes together in a dough.


Roll the pastry on a floured surface to½cm/¼in thickness. Use a small plate as a guide to cut the pastry into a circle.


Place on a baking tray and into the oven to bake for 12 minutes.


To make the topping, heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the garlic and shallot until softened.


Season the lamb with salt and freshly ground black pepper and add to the pan. Fry until cooked through, then remove from the pan and set aside.


Pour in the red wine and allow to bubble for 1 minute, then add the olives, tomatoes and mint. Stir together and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, place the pastry on a plate, spoon over the lamb mixture, crumble over the feta cheese and garnish with a few parsley leaves.
