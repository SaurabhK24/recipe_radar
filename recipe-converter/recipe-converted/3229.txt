Ingredients

100g/3½oz asparagus, halved
small handful fresh coriander, chopped
2 tomatoes, sliced
4 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp soy sauce
2 tsp sesame oil
1 lime, juice only
2 slices crusty white bread, cut into cubes
½ banana shallot, finely sliced
salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 quails' eggs




Method


Place all the ingredients except the quails' eggs into a large bowl and stir well.


To soft boil the quails' eggs, place the eggs into a saucepan of boiling water for just over two minutes. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and run under cold water for a minute. Peel the eggs and cut them in half.


To serve, spoon the salad onto a serving plate and garnish with the halved quails' eggs.
