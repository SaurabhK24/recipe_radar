This classic Scottish recipe works just as well with raspberries. You'll need a very large bowl to whip the cream, or do it in batches.

Ingredients

1kg/2lb 4oz porridge oats
150g/5½oz caster sugar
3 litres/5¼ pints double cream
3 litres/5¼ pints plain yoghurt
1.8kg/4lb fresh strawberries, hulled, chopped




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas mark 6.


Place the oats on two large baking trays, sprinkle the sugar over them and mix together. Bake in the oven for 7-8 minutes, or until lightly toasted.


Whisk the double cream until it reaches soft peaks. Stir in the yoghurt and almost all of the fresh fruit then fold in the toasted oats.


Place in serving dishes, top with the remaining fruit and chill until ready to serve.
