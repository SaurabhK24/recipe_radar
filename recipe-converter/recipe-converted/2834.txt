Ingredients
For the coconut French toast

6 tbsp coconut cream
1 free-range egg, beaten
2 tbsp caster sugar
1 vanilla pod, seeds only
¼ tsp ground cinnamon
2 slices baguette or other bread
2 tsp vegetable oil
1 tbsp butter

For the griddled mango

1 tsp brown sugar
½ mango, peeled, stone removed and scored
½ red chilli, finely chopped
1 tbsp honey




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Place the coconut cream, egg, sugar, vanilla seeds and cinnamon into a bowl and mix well.


Dip the bread into the egg mixture to completely coat.


Heat the vegetable oil and butter in a non-stick frying pan and fry the bread until golden-brown on both sides.


Meanwhile, for the mango, heat a griddle pan. Sprinkle the brown sugar over the mango and griddle cut-side down for 3-4 minutes until golden. Turn over, then transfer the pan to the oven and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the chilli and honey and cook for a further 2-3 minutes.


To serve, place the French toast onto a plate and top with the caramelised mango.
