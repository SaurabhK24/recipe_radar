Looking for something a bit different for brunch this weekend? Try beans on toast with a spicy Italian twist.






By Gino D'Acampo






Ingredients
For the toast

2 diagonal slices ciabatta or baguette
2 tbsp olive oil
1 garlic clove

For the spicy beans and spinach

1 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp dried chilli flakes
¼ onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
100g/3½oz spinach
55g/2oz kidney beans from a tin, rinsed and drained
1 tsp chopped parsley, to garnish, optional
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Rub the bread with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Heat a frying pan until smoking and chargrill the bread for 1 minute on each side until crisp and golden-brown. Rub the clove of garlic on both sides of each toasted ciabatta slice and set aside in a warm place.


For the spicy beans and spinach, heat the oil in a frying pan over a high heat. Add the chilli flakes, onion and garlic and fry until softened.


Add the spinach and beans and cook until the spinach has wilted and the beans are warmed through. Drain out any excess moisture and season with salt and pepper.


Put the toast on a plate, spoon over the beans and spinach mixture, then sprinkle over the parsley and serve.




Recipe Tips
This is a great recipe for using up bread that is going stale.
