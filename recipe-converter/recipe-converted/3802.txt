This salad is all about sourness. The combination of lemon and sumac really packs a punch. Great with a barbecue.

Ingredients
For the dressing

100ml/3½ fl oz olive oil
1 lemon, juice and zest
½ garlic clove, crushed
2 tbsp sumac (a sour-tasting ground spice, available in Middle Eastern delicatessens)
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the salad

1 pitta bread, torn into small pieces
8 plum tomatoes, seeds removed, quartered
half cucumber, peeled, cut into 5cm/2in batons
half green pepper, cut into strips
8 radishes, sliced
1 shallot, sliced
small handful rocket leaves
1 small Little Gem lettuce
handful fresh mint leaves




Method


For the dressing, place the olive oil, lemon juice and zest, crushed garlic and sumac into a bowl and whisk together to combine. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. (You will not need all the dressing for this recipe, so set the remainder aside in the fridge for up to a week.)


For the salad, place the torn pitta, tomatoes, cucumber, pepper, radishes, shallot, rocket leaves, Little Gem lettuce leaves and mint leaves into a large bowl and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, pour the dressing, to taste, over the salad and gently mix together to coat the salad evenly.
