Ingredients
For the pancakes

225g/8oz plain flour
1 tsp baking powder
2 free-range eggs
5 tbsp milk
1 tsp vegetable oil

For the apricot and butterscotch sauce

75g/2½oz sugar
75g/2½oz butter
75g/3oz dried apricots
50ml/2fl oz double cream, plus extra, to serve




Method


For the pancakes, place the plain flour, baking powder and eggs into a large bowl and whisk to combine, then gradually add the milk. Leave the mixture to rest for five minutes.


Heat the oil in a pancake pan or small frying pan over a medium to high heat, then add the batter in ladlefuls. Cook for two minutes, flip or turn with a fish slice and cook on the other side for another 1-2 minutes. Repeat with the rest of the mixture.


For the apricot and butterscotch sauce, place the sugar and 25g/1oz butter in a saucepan and cook over a high heat until the mixture turns amber-coloured.


Add the apricots to the pan and cook for another minute, then add the cream and lower the heat. Add the rest of the butter a little at a time, stirring continuously.


To serve, place a pile of pancakes onto a serving plate and drizzle over the sauce and extra cream if desired.
