Ingredients

100ml/3½fl oz vegetable oil
350g/12oz lamb, cut into bite-sized chunks
1 tbsp tomato purée
1 tsp beef stock granules, dissolved in 100ml/3½fl oz water
50g/1¾oz chopped onion
50g/1¾oz chopped carrots
50g/1¾oz chopped celery
salt and pepper
1 tbsp chopped fresh mint
2 tsp cornflour, mixed with 3 tsp water (optional)
300g/10½oz potatoes, sliced
1 tbsp melted butter
2 tsp dried parsley, to garnish (optional)
100ml/3½fl oz gravy, to serve




Method


Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed pan. Add the lamb and cook until golden-brown and then stir in the tomato purée.


Add the stock and simmer for 2-3 hours, or until the lamb is tender.


Add the onion, carrots and celery and cook until the vegetables are soft.


Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the mint and cook for 2-3 minutes. If necessary, thicken the sauce by adding the cornflour paste.


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Transfer the stew to an ovenproof dish. Place the sliced potatoes on top and brush with melted butter. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the potato topping is golden-brown.


Sprinkle with dried parsley and serve with gravy.
