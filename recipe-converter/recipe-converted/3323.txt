Paul Rankin's easy recipe for soft, buttery cookies takes less than half an hour.






By Paul Rankin


From Ready Steady Cook






Ingredients

8 tbsp plain flour
2 tbsp caster sugar
2 tbsp crunchy peanut butter
1 free-range egg yolk
50g/1¾oz butter, softened
icing sugar, for dusting




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Place the flour, sugar, peanut butter, egg yolk and butter into a large bowl and mix together until combined to a smooth dough.


With lightly floured hands, break off evenly sized pieces of the dough and roll into walnut sized balls.


Place the dough balls onto a baking sheet lined with silicon paper or baking parchment and gently press each ball with the back of a fork to flatten slightly.


Place in the oven and bake for ten minutes, or until just turning golden-brown.


Transfer the cookies to a wire rack and allow to cool for ten minutes.


To serve, place on a serving plate and dust with icing sugar.
