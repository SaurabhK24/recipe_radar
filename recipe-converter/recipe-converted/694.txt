Ingredients
For the turkey

250g/9oz turkey mince
100g/3½oz breadcrumbs
1 tbsp fresh chopped thyme
1 egg, beaten
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the sauce

1 tin chopped tomatoes
1 small bunch thyme, leaves picked
1 tbsp tomato purée
½ onion, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the sweet potato fondant

1 garlic clove, sliced
1 tbsp fresh chopped thyme
55g/2oz butter
100ml/3½fl oz chicken stock
100g/3½oz sweet potato, sliced into thin rounds




Method


For the turkey balls, place all of the ingredients into a large bowl and mix together well. Divide the mixture into two, shape into balls and place in the fridge, while you make the sauce.


For the sauce, place all of the ingredients into a deep frying pan over a medium heat. Bring to the boil and reduce the heat to a simmer for five minutes.


Add the turkey balls and cook in the sauce, turning occasionally. Poach for 15 minutes, or until the turkey balls are cooked through.


Meanwhile make the sweet potato fondant by placing all the ingredients into a small non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and cooking for ten minutes, stirring occasionally.


To serve, turn out the fondant onto a plate. Top with the turkey balls and spoon over any extra sauce.
