Ingredients
For the pan-fried sea bass

150g/5½oz sea bass fillet
dash olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the red risotto

dash olive oil
½ onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
30g/1oz chorizo, chopped
200g/7oz basmati rice, boiled for five minutes, then drained
pinch ground turmeric
1 tsp tomato purée
100ml/3½fl oz white wine

For the roasted cherry tomatoes

1 small bunch cherry tomatoes on the vine

Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the sea bass, rub the sea bass fillet with olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a griddle pan until very hot, place the sea bass fillet skin-side down into the pan and fry for three minutes. Turn over and fry for a further three minutes on the other side. Remove from the heat and keep warm.


For the risotto, heat the olive oil in a small saucepan, add the onion and fry over a gentle heat until softened but not coloured. Add the garlic and fry for one minute. Add the chorizo and fry for two minutes.


Add the blanched rice, turmeric and tomato purée to the pan and stir well. Add the wine and salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste, and simmer, stirring frequently, until the rice is al dente. Add Tabasco sauce, to taste.


For the roasted cherry tomatoes, place the cherry tomatoes into a small roasting tin. Drizzle with olive oil and salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste, and roast in the oven for 6-8 minutes.


To serve, pile the risotto onto a serving plate. Top with the pan-fried sea bass and garnish with the roasted cherry tomatoes.
