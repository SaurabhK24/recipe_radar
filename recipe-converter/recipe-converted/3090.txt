Ingredients

200g/7oz butter, softened
200g/7oz light muscovado sugar
100g/3½oz golden syrup
50g/1¾oz sunflower seeds
50g/1¾oz dried cranberries, chopped if large
100g/3½oz sultanas
50g/1¾oz desiccated coconut
100g/3½oz crisped rice cereal
150g/5½oz rolled oats




Method


Line a 23x30cm/9x12in traybake tin with cling film.


Add the butter, sugar and golden syrup to a large saucepan and stir over a medium heat until melted. Pour into a large bowl, stir in all the remaining ingredients until well combined.


Put the mixture into the prepared tin and spread with the back of a spoon into an even layer. Transfer to the fridge to chill, uncovered, for about 2 hours, or until firm.


Remove from the traybake tin and cut into 18 even-sized bars. Keep in an airtight container until needed.




Recipe Tips
If covered and chilled in the fridge, these bars can be made up to 3 days ahead.

  Chilling the mixture is so important, as it makes the bars much easier to cut.
