This rich, sweet pastry makes a delicious base for chocolate tarts or fruit pies.



Ingredients

90g/3½oz butter, softened
65g/2½oz caster sugar
3 free-range egg yolks
200g/7oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting




Method


Cream the butter and sugar together in a bowl until well combined, then beat in the egg yolks, one at a time until fully incorporated into the mixture.


Mix in the flour until the mixture comes together as a ball of dough.


Tip the pastry out onto a floured work surface and knead briefly until smooth.


Wrap the pastry in cling film and chill for 30 minutes. Alternatively, it can be frozen for use at a later date.
