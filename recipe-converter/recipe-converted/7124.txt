Ingredients

4 pork loin steaks
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 tbsp Dijon mustard
1 glass dry white wine
290ml/10fl oz vegetable stock
1 lemon, juice only
12 whole sage leaves
salt and pepper

For the coleslaw

Â½ red cabbage, finely chopped
2 carrots, grated
1 spanish onion, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
2 tbsp olive oil
1 lemon, juice only
4 tbsp mayonnaise
255g/9oz dried apricots, sliced
1 tbsp white wine vinegar
1 tsp calvados
5 tbsp olive oil
pinch dried or fresh sage




Method


Soak the sliced apricots in the white wine vinegar, calavados, some olive oil and some sage for 1 hour.


Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan. Pan-fry the pork loin steaks very lightly on both sides. Add the garlic, mustard, wine and vegetable stock, lemon juice, sage, salt and pepper and apricots. Reduce by a half and allow to simmer for up to 5 minutes (longer depending on thickness of steak).


Mix all the coleslaw ingredients in a large bowl. Season, cover and chill in the fridge if you have time.


Serve the pork on a bed of coleslaw and the apricots on top with the remaining sauce in the pan drizzled over. Add some sage leaves to garnish.
