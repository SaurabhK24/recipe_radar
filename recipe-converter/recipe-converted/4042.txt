Freekeh is dried green wheat, harvested while the grains are still soft, then sun-dried. It is very common in the Middle East and North Africa, and is used in the same way as bulgur, couscous or pearled spelt. It works well as an accompanying pilaf or a salad, in this case with pomegranate seeds, pistachios, mint and spring onion.

Ingredients

200g/7oz freekeh, pearled spelt or pearled barley
5 tbsp olive oil
4 spring onions, finely chopped
1 pomegranate, seeds only
handful flatleaf parsley, roughly chopped
handful mint, roughly chopped
1 tbsp pomegranate molasses
2 tbsp pistachios, roughly crushed
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Put the freekeh and 1 litre/1¾ pint water in a pan together with 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Bring to the boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes until just tender. Drain and allow to cool.


When cool, mix together the freekeh with the spring onions, pomegranate seeds and herbs. Season with salt and pepper.


Whisk together the remaining 4 tablespoons of olive oil and the pomegranate molasses with a pinch of salt, and dress the salad with it, mixing gently. Serve topped with pistachios.
