Ingredients

4 tbsp vegetable oil
500g/1lb 2oz good-quality beef mince
2 onions, diced
2 garlic cloves, crushed
2 carrots, diced
2 celery stalks, diced
2 red peppers, diced
1 heaped tsp chilli powder
1 heaped tsp ground cumin
1 heaped tsp ground cinnamon
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 x 400g/14oz can red kidney beans, drained
2 x 400g/14oz cans chopped tomatoes

To serve

soured cream
chopped fresh coriander leaves
lime wedges
nachos




Method


Heat two tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the mince and fry until golden-brown all over.


Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a saucepan over a medium to high heat. Add the onions, garlic, carrots, celery and peppers and fry until softened.


Add the chilli powder, cumin and cinnamon and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fry for a further 4-5 minutes, stirring well.


Remove the mince from the pan using a slotted spoon and add to the vegetable mixture.


Add the drained kidney beans and the chopped tinned tomatoes and bring the mixture to the boil. Reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering, then half-cover the pan with a lid and simmer for about an hour, stirring every now and again to stop it from catching on the bottom of the pan.


To serve, ladle the chilli into four serving bowls. Drizzle over the soured cream. Sprinkle with the chopped coriander. Garnish with the lime wedges and serve with nachos alongside.
