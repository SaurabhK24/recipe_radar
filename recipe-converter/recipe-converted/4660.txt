Ingredients
For the haggis 'koftas'

Â½ cooked haggis, chopped
1 tsp ground ginger
1 tsp chilli powder
1 tsp ground turmeric
1 tsp ground coriander
1 free-range egg
1 tbsp plain flour
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil

For the yoghurt dressing

4 tbsp plain yoghurt
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives
1 tbsp chopped fresh mint
1 lime, zest and juice
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the haggis koftas, place all the ingredients, except the olive oil, in a food processor and pulse until combined.


Soak four wooden skewers in a bowl of water for about 20 minutes to prevent them from burning.


Shape the haggis mixture around the skewers and rub with the oil. Heat a griddle pan until hot and cook the koftas until browned on all sides and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes.


For the dressing, place all the dressing ingredients into a bowl and mix well.


Serve the koftas on a plate with the dressing in a bowl on the side.
