Ingredients

10 asparagus spears, trimmed
salt
1 tbsp white wine vinegar
2 eggs
4 slices of brioche, toasted

For the hollandaise sauce

1 egg yolk
1 lemon, juice only
1 tbsp water
110g/4oz clarified butter, warmed
cayenne pepper and salt, to season




Method


Steam the asparagus over plenty of boiling water for 3-5 minutes (depending on the thickness of the spears).


Bring a pan of salted water to the boil and add the vinegar. Whisk to make a whirlpool. Once it's settled, crack an egg in the middle. Simmer for 2-3 minutes, remove and keep warm. Repeat with the other eggs.


Make the hollandaise by putting the egg yolk, lemon juice and water into a blender. Turn on the machine and then slowly pour the warmed butter through the lid. Season with cayenne pepper and salt.


Pile 5-6 spears of asparagus on to each toasted brioche. Top with a poached egg. Spoon on the hollandaise sauce and serve.
