Ingredients
For the butternut squash curry

150g/ 5¼oz butternut squash (base section)
2tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
50g/1¾oz unsalted butter
1tbsp curry powder

For the cabbage

1 garlic clove, sliced
25g/1oz unsalted butter
200g/7oz cabbage, shredded

For the lamb

150g/5¾oz lamb (leg steak)




Method


To make the butternut squash curry, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Leaving the skin on, remove the seeds from the butternut squash and cut into wedges. Toss in the olive oil and season well.


Heat a griddle pan. Place the butternut squash wedges onto the griddle, cooking for four to five minutes, turning to create grill marks.


Place the butternut on a baking-sheet. Sprinkle the curry powder over and distribute the unsalted butter in small knobs. Place in the oven and bake for ten minutes.


To make the cabbage, heat a medium frying pan, melt the butter and add the sliced garlic. Cook for one minute.


Add the shredded cabbage and cook for ten minutes, allowing to wilt down.


To cook the lamb steak, put the griddle pan onto a high heat. Season the lamb steak on both sides, place in the pan and cook for one and a half minutes on each side or until cooked to your liking.


To serve, arrange a cabbage base on a warm plate. Place the curried butternut on top and serve the lamb steaks on the side.
