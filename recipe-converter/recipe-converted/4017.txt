Sounds awfully posh, doesn't it? But these potatoes are really an easy and luxurious side dish to a roast or steak.

Ingredients

150g/5oz butter
4 potatoes, peeled, cut into barrel-shapes using a cookie cutter
75ml/3fl oz chicken or vegetable stock
2 garlic cloves, peeled, crushed lightly with the edge of a knife
2-3 sprigs fresh thyme
sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Heat the butter over a medium heat in a saucepan. When the butter is foaming, add the potatoes and fry until deep golden-brown on one side, about 5-6 minutes. (Do not move the potatoes as they cook.)


Turn over the potatoes and cook for a further 5-6 minutes, or until golden-brown on both sides.


Carefully pour in the stock, then add the garlic cloves and thyme sprigs. (CAUTION: the hot fat will splutter when it comes into contact with the stock.) Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Cover the pan with a lid and reduce the heat until the stock is simmering. Simmer the potatoes until tender, then remove the potatoes from the pan using a slotted spoon and keep warm.
