Ingredients
For the marinade

1 tbsp groundnut oil
3 garlic cloves, chopped
2 tbsp grated fresh root ginger
1 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry (optional)
2 tbsp light soy sauce
2 tsp five-spice powder
2 tbsp honey

For the chicken

1kg/2lb chicken drumsticks, skin on




Method


For the marinade, put all of the marinade ingredients into a large bowl and stir to combine. Add the chicken and allow to marinate while you preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.


Put the chicken drumsticks on a roasting tray and roast for 20-30 minutes, or until the skin is golden and the chicken is cooked through. (To check, pierce the drumstick at its thickest part, next to the bone. The juices should run clear.)




Recipe Tips
You can make this ahead - cover the bowl with cling film, then place into the fridge to marinate for at least 15-20 minutes or overnight.
