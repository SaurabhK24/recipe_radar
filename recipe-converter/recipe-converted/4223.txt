Use whatever game you can get for this tasty recipe. It requires a little work, but the results are well worth the effort.






By Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall






Ingredients

selection of lean game meat, about 1kg/2¼lb in all, which could include:
breasts of pheasant (hung about 5 days)
breasts of pigeon
breasts of duck or other wild fowl
saddle and hindquarters of 1 rabbit, boned
saddle and hindquarters of hare, boned
lean strips of venison (from the leg or fillet)
oil or fat, for frying

For the forcemeat

500g/1lb2oz sausage meat
livers from all the game, finely chopped
2 handfuls fresh white breadcrumbs
1 egg
3 tbsp parsley, finely chopped
few sprigs of thyme, leaves removed and chopped
5-6 juniper berries, crushed in pestle and mortar
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
splash of brandy
splash of red wine
salt and pepper

To line the dish

300g/10½oz streaky bacon, flattened with the back of a knife




Method


In a large mixing bowl combine the sausage meat and the chopped livers from the game.


Next add the breadcrumbs, egg, parsley, thyme, juniper berries and garlic. Then the wine and brandy, season with the salt and pepper and mix everything together thoroughly, preferably with your hands.


Cut the game meat into roughly same-size strips, about 2 fingers thick.


In a heavy-based frying pan heat the fat or oil and fry the game pieces for 2 minutes until nicely browned.


Line a loaf tin or ceramic terrine dish with the stretched rashers of streaky bacon. Add a layer of forcemeat followed by a layer of game meat, then a layer of forcemeat followed by another layer of game meat. (If you like, you can put the same kind of meat in each layer, ie a layer of rabbit, a layer of pigeon and then a layer of pheasant). However many layers you make (I usually go for three) be sure to finish with a layer of the forcemeat.


Fold the exposed strips of bacon over the top of the terrine and cover well with kitchen foil. If your terrine dish has a lid on it so much the better.


Place the terrine dish in a roasting tin half-filled with hot water. Cook in the oven at 160C/325F/Gas 3 for approximately 1½-2 hours. Test with a skewer to see if it is cooked, if the skewer does not come out of the terrine piping hot then it is not ready.


For the best possible texture and easy slicing, your terrine should be pressed as it cools. Find a piece of wood or plastic that fits snugly inside the terrine dish and weigh it down with a brick or two. (Another similar size dish or loaf tin with a brick inside often does the trick, but wrap it in cling film if you're using a tin.) Leave the terrine until completely cold for several hours or overnight.


To serve the terrine, slice it thickly with a very sharp knife, put on a plate with a small salad of lightly dressed green leaves and a blob of good fruit chutney. Serve with hot toast.
