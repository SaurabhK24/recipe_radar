A ten minute dessert that combines salted caramel, banana and cheesecake flavours. This is a truly indulgent dessert for the lone diner.

Ingredients

100g/3½oz full-fat cream cheese
100ml/3½fl oz crème fraîche
1 vanilla pod, split in half and seeds scraped out
75ml/3fl oz double cream
50g/1¾oz dulce de leche
½ tsp sea salt
40g/1½ oz caster sugar
1 banana, peeled, ends trimmed off
25g/1oz butter
1 chocolate digestive biscuit
25g/1oz dark chocolate, 70% cocoa, grated




Method


For the caramel cream, put the cream cheese, crème fraiche, vanilla seeds and 50ml/2fl oz of the double cream in a bowl and whisk until well combined.


Put the dulce de leche and salt into a small bowl and mix. Lightly fold into the cream mixture until just marbled through. Set aside.


Heat the sugar in a frying pan until golden-brown and liquid. Add the banana and coat in the caramel.


Remove the banana, whisk the butter and the rest of the cream into the caramel in the pan, then put the banana back in and coat once more.


To serve, crumble the biscuit onto a serving plate, place the caramel-coated banana on top, drizzle with the caramel sauce from the pan you cooked the banana in. Finish with a scoop of caramel cream. Finally, sprinkle the grated chocolate over the top.
