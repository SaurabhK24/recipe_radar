Ingredients

450g/1lb treacle
125g/¼lb coarse brown sugar
55g/2oz ground ginger
25g/1oz candied orange-peel
25g/1oz candied angelica
15g/½oz candied lemon-peel
15g/½oz coriander seeds
15g/½oz caraway seeds
1 egg
flour




Method


Put the treacle into a basin, and pour over it the melted butter, the sugar and ginger. Stir these ingredients well together, and whilst mixing, add the candied peel, which should be cut into very small pieces, but not bruised, and the caraway and coriander seeds, which should be pounded.


Having mixed it all thoroughly together, break in an egg, and work the whole mixture together with as much flour as is necessary to form a paste. Roll this out and stamp into nuts of any size and put them on a tin plate, and bake in a slow oven from ¼ to ½ hour.
