Ingredients
For the meringues

6 free-range egg whites
300g/10½oz caster sugar
50g/2oz chocolate (70 per cent cocoa solids), grated
3 tbsp cocoa powder
1 tsp sherry vinegar
150g/5oz hazelnuts, shelled, toasted, roughly chopped

For the filling

400ml/14fl oz double cream, whipped until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed
1 vanilla pod, split, seeds scraped out
1 tbsp sugar

For the sauce

200g/7oz ready-made chocolate hazelnut spread
100g/3½oz unsalted butter
200ml/7fl oz double cream
2 tbsp hazelnut liqueur




Method


Preheat oven to 180C/365F/Gas 4.


For the meringues, beat the egg whites in a bowl until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed.


Add the sugar, one tablespoon at a time, whisking well.


Add the chocolate, cocoa powder, vinegar and nuts and gently fold into the meringue mixture.


Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper and spoon small mounds of meringue mixture onto it.


Transfer the tray to the oven and turn down the heat to 150C/300F/Gas 2 immediately and bake for 45-50 minutes. (The meringues should be crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle.)


For the filling, place the cream, vanilla seeds and sugar into a clean bowl and mix together well.


For the sauce, place the chocolate hazelnut spread, butter, double cream and hazelnut liqueur into a pan over a low heat. Allow the ingredients to melt, stirring occasionally, until combined.


To serve, place a dollop of filling mixture between two meringues. Place onto a plate and pour the sauce over the top. Repeat with the remaining meringues and serve.
