Dough balls are readily available in supermarkets and make an excellent base for hot canapés.

Ingredients

16 ready-to-cook dough balls
75g/2½oz full-fat cream cheese
salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
3 tbsp mango chutney




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and line a baking tray with non-stick paper or foil.


Slice each dough ball in half horizontally. On the baking trays, arrange the half dough balls up on the rounded part with the cut side up. You may need to slice a small piece off the rounded base so that they sit flat on the tray without toppling over.


Mix the cream cheese with salt, pepper, chives and parsley and spread the cheese mixture over the flat side of each ball, spreading right to the edges. Spoon a small blob of mango chutney on top.


Bake for about 10-12 minutes or until golden-brown and hot.


Arrange on a flat platter and serve hot.




Recipe Tips
These can be made up to 12 hours ahead and kept in the fridge. They also freeze well without the mango chutney on top, for up to a month.
