Ingredients

3 chicken mini-fillets
½ courgette
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp soy sauce

To serve

1 lime, cut into wedges
½ orange, cut into wedges
small handful mixed red and yellow cherry tomatoes, halved
sprig fresh parsley




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Cut each chicken mini-fillet in half and cut the courgette half into six pieces. Thread the chicken and courgette pieces alternately onto two skewers.


Heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan and fry the chicken and courgette skewers for 4-5 minutes, turning frequently, until they begin to turn golden-brown.


Sprinkle over the soy sauce and transfer to the oven to cook for five minutes, or until the chicken is completely cooked through.


Serve with a garnish of orange and lime wedges, halved cherry tomatoes and a sprig of fresh parsley.
