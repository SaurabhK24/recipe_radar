Bring the flavours of the Mediterranean to your plate with this mouthwatering meal of lamb chops, fresh herbs, roasted veg and crumbly feta.



Ingredients

4 lean lamb chops or cutlets
1 tbsp, fresh mint
1 tbsp, fresh rosemary
2 cloves garlic
2 tbsp olive oil
1 small aubergine, sliced
1 courgette, sliced
1 red or yellow pepper, cut in large chunks
50g/2oz feta cheese, crumbled
250g/9oz cherry tomatoes




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 5.


Using a pestle and mortar or wooden spoon and bowl, pound together the fresh mint, fresh rosemary and the garlic, then mix with 1 tbsp olive oil. Smear over four lean lamb chops or cutlets.


Place the aubergine, courgette and red or yellow pepper on to a baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 tbsp olive oil and place the lamb chops on top. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes.


Top the chops with feta cheese and add the cherry tomatoes to the pan. Cook for a further 10 minutes until the cheese just starts to brown.


Serve the chops with the roasted vegetables, toasted ciabatta bread and mixed leaf salad.
