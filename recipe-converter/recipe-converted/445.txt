Ingredients
For the toffee bananas

50g/1¾oz unsalted butter
50g/1¾oz caster sugar
1 lime, juice only
50g/1¾oz hazelnuts, chopped
1 banana, peeled and roughly chopped

For the vanilla yoghurt

150g/5¼oz Greek yoghurt
1 vanilla pod, seeds scraped out

For the orange glaze

50ml/2fl oz runny honey
1 vanilla pod, seeds scraped out
½ orange, juice only




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


To make the toffee bananas, melt the butter in an ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat. When the butter foams add the sugar, lime juice and chopped nuts. Continue to cook for 2-3 minutes, until thickened.


Add the banana and stir well to coat in the mixture. Transfer to the oven and bake for five minutes.


To make the vanilla yoghurt, place the yoghurt and the vanilla seeds into a small bowl and mix well.


To make orange glaze, heat a frying pan and add the honey, vanilla pod and seeds and the orange juice. Stir together well and simmer until the mixture reaches a thick, syrupy consistency.


To serve, place the toffee bananas on a plate, drizzle the orange glaze over and spoon the vanilla yoghurt onto the side.
