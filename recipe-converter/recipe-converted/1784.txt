Ingredients
For the chargrilled liver

100g/3½oz lamb's liver, cut into two pieces
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the carrot salad

2 large carrots, peeled
3 tbsp olive oil
½ orange, zest and juice
2 tbsp chopped fresh chives




Method


For the liver, heat a griddle pan until hot. Rub the liver with the oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Chargrill on both sides for about 2-3 minutes, or until just cooked through.


For the carrot salad, using a mandoline, shred the carrots into long strips. Whisk the olive oil, orange zest and juice and chives together in a small bowl, then pour over the carrots and stir.


To serve, place the liver on a bed of the carrot salad on a serving plate.
