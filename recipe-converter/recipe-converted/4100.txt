Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
½ onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, chopped
85g/3oz fresh peas, podded
2 large handfuls baby spinach
300ml/½ pint hot vegetable stock
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives




Method


Heat the olive oil in a saucepan, add the onion and fry gently until softened but not coloured. Add the garlic and fry for one minute.


Add the peas, spinach and hot stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for eight minutes, or until the peas are tender. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and blend with a hand-blender until smooth.


To serve, pour into a bowl and garnish with chopped fresh chives and a drizzle of olive oil.
