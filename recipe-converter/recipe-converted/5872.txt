Ingredients

4 strawberries, hulled and sliced
300ml/½ pint double cream
3 tbsp Greek-style yoghurt
4 tbsp condensed milk
½ lime, zest and juice
55g/2oz dark chocolate, melted




Method


Put two 10cm/4in diameter chefs' rings on two plates. Line the edges with strawberry slices.


Whisk the cream in a mixing bowl until it forms soft peaks. Stir in the Greek-style yoghurt, condensed milk and lime zest. Add the lime juice, to thicken the mixture.


Spoon the cream mixture into the strawberry-lined rings and level off the top. Place in the fridge to set for 5-10 minutes, or longer if possible.


Release the cheesecakes from the rings by heating carefully with a cook's blowtorch around the outside. Drizzle with the melted chocolate and serve.
