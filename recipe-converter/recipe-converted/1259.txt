Use goose fat, beef dripping or lard to get perfect restaurant-style fluffy Yorkies with this easy recipe. If you’re vegetarian you can use any flavourless oil instead (such as sunflower or rapeseed oil).






By Allegra McEvedy






Ingredients

125g/4½oz plain flour
2 medium free-range eggs
300ml/10fl oz full-fat milk
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 tbsp goose fat, beef dripping or lard (if you are vegetarian, you can use rapeseed oil, sunflower oil or vegetable oil)




Method


Sieve the flour into a large bowl. Add the eggs and whisk in. Once incorporated, gradually whisk in the milk a little at a time, Whisk to a smooth batter, season with salt and pepper and then pour the batter into a jug. Cover with cling film and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
