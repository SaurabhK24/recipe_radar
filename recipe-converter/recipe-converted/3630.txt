Ingredients
For the poached egg

500ml/18fl oz boiling water
50ml/2fl oz white wine vinegar
1 egg

For the hollandaise

50ml/2fl oz white wine vinegar
5 peppercorns
½ shallot, finely chopped
1 bay leaf
1 egg yolk
150g/5½fl oz melted butter
salt and freshly ground black pepper

To serve

½ ripe avocado, stone removed




Method


To poach the egg, place the water and vinegar a saucepan and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and swirl the water with a spoon to create a whirlpool effect.


Carefully add the egg into the centre of the whirlpool and poach for three minutes, or until cooked to your liking.


To make the hollandaise, place the vinegar, peppercorns, shallot and bay leaf in a small non-reactive saucepan over a high heat. Boil rapidly reducing the volume of liquid to about a tablespoon, then remove from the heat and allow to cool for one minute.


Place the egg yolk into a large glass bowl and whisk in the cooled vinegar reduction through a sieve.


Gradually add the melted butter, whisking vigorously and continuously. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, place the avocado in the centre of a plate. Place the poached egg onto the avocado and pour over the hollandaise.
