Ingredients

2 free-range eggs
5 tbsp/75ml double cream
1 tbsp caster sugar
1 reday-made teacake, sliced horizontally into three
1 tbsp butter
110g/4oz tinned apricots, drained
3 tbsp marmalade
1 tbsp chopped fresh mint




Method


Whisk the eggs, cream and sugar together to form a batter then dip the teacake pieces into the batter until well coated.


Heat the butter in a non-stick frying pan and fry the bread on each side for 2-3 minutes, or until golden brown on both sides.


Place the apricots and marmalade into a separate frying pan and warm until the jam melts. Stir in the mint.


To serve stack the fried teacake slices on a plate and spoon over the sticky apricots.
