Ingredients
For the buttered shortbread

175g/6oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting
110g/4oz butter, slightly softened
50g/2oz caster sugar, plus extra for sprinkling
1 free-range egg yolk
2 tsp milk

For the warm glazed strawberries

100g/3½oz strawberries, hulled and sliced
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 tbsp white wine
2 tbsp icing sugar
squeeze lemon juice
double cream, whipped, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.


Place the flour, butter and sugar into a food processor and pulse until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.


Add the egg yolk and milk and pulse again until the mixture comes together into a ball. Leave to rest for five minutes.


On a clean, floured work surface, roll the dough out to 0.5cm/½in thick with a rolling pin and cut into 3 x 6cm/2½in rounds. Place onto a baking sheet lined with silicon paper, sprinkle with a little more caster sugar and bake for 15 minutes, or until just turning golden on top. Place onto a wire rack and leave to cool.


For the strawberries, place the strawberries, vanilla extract, wine, icing sugar and lemon juice into a small pan and cook over a gentle heat for five minutes, or until the strawberries are softened but still retain their shape.


To serve, place one round of shortbread onto a serving plate and top with half of the strawberries and a spoonful of whipped cream. Top with another round of shortbread, the remaining strawberries and cream and finish with the last piece of shortbread.
