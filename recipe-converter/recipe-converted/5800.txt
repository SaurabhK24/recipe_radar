To make the pancakes, in a large bowl whisk together all of the pancake ingredients, except for the oil, to form a thick batter.


Heat the oil in a crepe pan, then ladle spoonfuls of the mixture into the frying pan.


Fry the pancakes for one minute on both sides until coloured, then pile up on a warm plate.


To make the strawberry compote, in a frying pan heat the strawberries with the orange zest and juice and the sugar.


Add the champagne and cook down until the liquid volume is reduced by half.


To make the vanilla cream, mix the clotted cream with the sugar and vanilla seeds.


Serve the pancakes on a warm plate with the strawberry compote spooned around. Garnish with a spoonful of the vanilla cream and a sprig of mint on top.
