A quick and light way to serve salmon fillets. Sumac has lovely citrus flavours which will complement the zests. Serve with a fattoush salad or Persian herb rice - or both.

Ingredients

4 tbsp dried edible rose petals, finely ground
2 tsp sumac
1 tsp dried lime powder
1 tsp ground cumin
½ tsp ground cinnamon
1 orange, zest only
1 lime, zest only
3-6 tbsp olive oil
6 x 100g/3½oz skinless salmon fillets
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 lemon cut into 6 wedges, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper.


Combine the ground rose petals, spices, orange zest and lime zest in a small bowl. Add the olive oil and stir well to form a wet marinade for the salmon.


Rub each salmon fillet well with the marinade and place it on the prepared baking tray. (At this stage you can cover with clingfilm and leave overnight in the refrigerator to marinate, if you wish). Once all the fillets are well coated in the marinade, season them generously with sea salt and black pepper.


Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through. Serve with lemon wedges.
