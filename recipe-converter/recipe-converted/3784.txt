Veggie fajitas are a fun way to feed the family and making your own is much cheaper than buying the boxed kits.

Ingredients

2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 onion, chopped
1 red chilli, seeds removed and chopped
1 garlic clove, chopped
2 x 110g tins kidney beans, washed and drained
vegetable stock or water

For the simple salsa

4 tomatoes, seeds removed and chopped
½ red onion, chopped
small bunch coriander, chopped
1 lime

To serve

1 packet of wheat tortillas
250ml/9fl oz plain yoghurt or soured cream




Method


For the filling, add the oil to a pan and cook the onion, chilli and garlic until softened. Add the beans and cook for a further 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add a little vegetable stock, about half a small glass, cook the beans until the mixture is smooth and not runny.


Mash the beans roughly with the back of a fork or a potato masher, then set aside.


For the salsa, mix together the tomatoes, red onion, a squeeze of lime juice and a handful of the chopped fresh coriander.


Just before you are ready to eat, add the remaining coriander and a squeeze of lime juice to the beans.


Warm each tortilla through in a pan and put on a plate, spoon over some of the filling, add a spoonful of the yoghurt and a little salsa. Roll up and serve immediately.
