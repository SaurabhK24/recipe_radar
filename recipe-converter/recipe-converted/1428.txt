2 carrots, peeled and finely diced
1 onion, peeled and finely diced
3 branches thyme, leaves removed
4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
olive oil
2kg/4lbs 2oz beef/plum tomatoes skinned, seeded and chopped
850ml/1Â½pt fish stock
salt and freshly ground pepper
sugar
6 monkfish steaks on the bone
12 squid rings
12 king prawns
6 small bass or bream fillets
12 mussels
1 baguette
125g/4oz butter
6 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 tbsp parsley, finely chopped




Method


Cook the carrots, onion, thyme and garlic in some olive oil over a low heat.


Add the tomatoes and the fish stock.


Season with salt, pepper and a little sugar.


Cover the sauce with a cartouche made from baking paper.


Cook slowly for up to 2 hours. (At this stage, the burrida can be stored in the fridge for 48 hours.)


When you want to serve, reheat the sauce adding the fish and cook for about 5-10 minutes until all the fish is cooked.


Mix the softened butter with the garlic and parsley. Slice the baguette at an angle, grill on both sides and then spread on the parsley and garlic butter. Serve with the fish stew.
