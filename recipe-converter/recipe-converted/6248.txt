Meatloaf is easy, tasty and economical. Serve with buttery jacket potatoes for a comfort food supper.



Ingredients

750g/1lb 10oz lean minced beef
175g/6oz pork sausage meat
1 egg, beaten
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon sage leaves, chopped
1 tablespoon mustard
1 heaped tablespoon tomato purée
110g/4oz fresh breadcrumbs
½ tsp paprika
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Heat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas4.


Place all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and mix thoroughly - it s best to use your hands here.


Transfer the mix to a 900g/2lb loaf tin and pat down until level. Cover the top of the mixture with an oiled piece of greaseproof paper.


Bake in the oven for 1 hour 30 minutes or until the meatloaf is cooked through. (Remove the paper 15 minutes before the end of cooking).




Recipe Tips
If you prefer, you can place the meatloaf to bake in a bain marie (water bath) ie: in a baking tin half filled with water. Cook for a further 20-30 minutes if needs be. Baking the loaf in a bain marie ensures the meatloaf cooks through evenly and stays moist.
