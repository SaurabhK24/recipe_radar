By The Vegetarian Society






Ingredients

1 tbsp groundnut oil
1 onion, peeled and finely chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
1.25cm/½in piece fresh ginger, peeled
675g/1½lb sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
1 tbsp chopped lemongrass
570ml/1 pint vegetable stock
1 x 400ml tin coconut milk
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 limes, zest and juice




Method


Heat the oil in a large saucepan and gently fry the onion, garlic and ginger for about 5 minutes until tender. Add the sweet potatoes and lemongrass and cook for a further 3 minutes.


Add the stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes until the vegetables are tender.


Cool the soup slightly, then liquidise with the coconut milk and process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Heat through without allowing the soup to boil, and add the lime juice. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with the lime zest.
