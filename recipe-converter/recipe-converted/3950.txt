Ingredients

vegetable oil, for deep-frying
1 lemon sole fillet, cut into strips
110g/4oz plain flour
1 free-range egg
salt and freshly ground black pepper
splash of carbonated water

For the dip

110g/4oz Greek yoghurt
2 tbsp fresh chives, chopped
squeeze of lime juice
Â½ lime, cut into wedges




Method


Heat a heavy bottomed saucepan, a third full of vegetable oil, until a breadcrumb sizzles in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous! Do not leave unattended.)


Place the flour in a large bowl and beat in the egg and salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.


Add the carbonated water and whisk to create a batter the consistency of double cream.


Dredge the sole pieces in flour then dip pieces into the batter to coat.


Place in the hot oil and deep-fry for 2-3 minutes, until crisp and golden. Carefully remove using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towels.


To make the dip, mix the yoghurt with the chives and lime juice. Transfer to a serving bowl.


Serve the fish fingers on a plate with the dip and lime wedges alongside.
