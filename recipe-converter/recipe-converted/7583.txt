Ingredients
For the pesto

3 large handfuls fresh basil leaves
25g/1oz pine nuts
3 tbsp olive oil
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
25g/1oz parmesan, grated

For the roasted sea bass

½ sea bass fillet, skin scored
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the sauce vierge

2 tbsp olive oil
1 vine tomato, seeds removed, chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
½ lemon, juice only

To serve

150g/5½oz cooked fresh tagliatelle, kept warm
handful broccoli florets, blanched




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the pesto sauce, place all the pesto ingredients in the bowl of a small food processor and pulse until smooth.


For the roasted sea bass, heat an ovenproof griddle pan until hot and oil the fish. Sear the bass on both sides, then transfer to the oven to roast for 4-5 minutes, or until cooked through.


For the sauce vierge, place all the ingredients into a pan and heat through gently for 4-5 minutes.


To serve, stir the pesto through the cooked tagliatelle and place onto a serving plate. Place the roasted bass fillet on top and arrange the broccoli florets around the side. Drizzle over the sauce vierge.
