Ingredients

100g/3½oz butter
200g/7oz soft dark brown sugar e.g. unrefined muscovado
250ml/9fl oz orange juice
2 tsp ground mixed spice
½ tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp ginger

250g/9oz Bramley apples

100g/3½oz dried cranberries or raisins
200g/7oz mixed candied peel, finely chopped
1 tbsp grated orange zest
150ml brandy, cognac, rum or whisky




Method


Combine the butter, sugar, orange juice and all the spices in a saucepan, and leave on a gentle heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter has melted and the mixture is smooth.


Peel, quarter, core and finely chop the apples. Add the chopped apples to the pan, along with the sultanas, currants, cranberries or raisins, candied peel and orange zest, stirring well.


Bring to the boil, and simmer gently for 10 minutes or until the apples have softened, then set aside.


Add the brandy or other alcohol and allow to cool.


When cold, spoon into clean, dry jars, and seal tightly and refrigerate for up to a month until required.


To keep for up to six months, double the amount of alcohol.
