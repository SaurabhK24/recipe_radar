Method


To make the salsa combine the cucumber, tomato, red onion, chilli, mint and coriander in a bowl. Add the rice vinegar and soya sauce. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground pepper.


Meanwhile, for the sea bass, heat a large non-stick frying pan. When hot, add the butter and put the fish fillets skin-side down on it. Cook for 2-3 minutes.


Carefully turn the fish fillets and add prawns to the pan. Cook for further 2-3 minutes. Remove from pan.


Tip the spring onions and mangetout into the pan used for the fish, cook for 2-3 minutes or until just tender.


To serve, divide the salsa between the plates, top with the spring onions and mangetout and place the fish on top skin-side up. Arrange the prawns around the plates and squeeze over a little lime juice.
