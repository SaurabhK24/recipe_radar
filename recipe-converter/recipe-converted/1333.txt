This is a wonderful summer dish and perfect for using up a glut of runner beans. This recipe cuts out all the usual stirring in a risotto making it really easy too.

Ingredients

150g/5½oz runner beans
dash olive oil
1 large onion, finely chopped
300g/10½oz risotto rice
1 litre/1¾ pints vegetable stock
3 tbsp mascarpone (optional)
50g/2oz parmesan (or similar vegetarian hard cheese), finely grated, plus extra to serve
200g/7oz cooked broad beans
3 knobs butter
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 heaped tbsp chopped fresh herbs (a mixture of chervil, tarragon, chives and flatleaf parsley)




Method


String the runner beans, slice them into 2cm/¾in pieces and cook in a pan of boiling water until tender. Drain and set aside.


Heat the olive oil in a large lidded saucepan, then add the onion and cook over a low heat for 3-4 minutes, or until softened.


Stir in the rice and cook for a further 2-3 minutes, stirring continuously.


Pour over the stock, stir the mixture and cover with the lid. Cook over a low heat for 15-17 minutes, or until the rice is just tender.


Stir in the mascarpone (if using), parmesan, butter, broad beans and runner beans and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Sprinkle over the herbs to serve.
