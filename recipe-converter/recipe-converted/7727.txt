Ingredients
For the pastry

150g/5½oz plain flour
100g/3½oz cold butter, cut into cubes
1 free-range egg, beaten

For the filling

1 apple, cored, thinly sliced
2 tsp lemon juice
4 tbsp mayonnaise
60g/2¼oz cheddar, cut into small wedges
1 celery stick, thinly sliced
3 spring onions, thinly sliced
6 cherry tomatoes, halved
4 tbsp pickle or chutney
chopped celery leaves to garnish




Method


For the pastry pulse the flour and butter in a food processor until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. With the motor running, add the beaten egg and blend until the mixture starts to come together in a ball. Shape the dough into a ball and flatten slightly.


Roll the pastry out on a floured work surface, and using a 7.5cm/3in cutter, cut out 12 rounds. Use them to line a 12-hole muffin tin.


Prick the base of the pastry with a fork, and freeze for one hour.


Pre-heat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Bake the pastry cases for 15-18 minutes, or until lightly browned and cooked through.


Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool.


For the filling, coat the apple slices in lemon juice to prevent them from browning.


Spoon a little mayonnaise into each pastry case and arrange small pieces of apple, cheese, celery, spring onion and tomato on top.


Add half a teaspoon of pickle or chutney and garnish with a few celery leaves.




Recipe Tips
Once cool, the pastry cases can be stored in an airtight container for up to three days.
