Ingredients

½ large potato, peeled and cut into cubes
25g/1oz butter
3 tbsp double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper
½ pear, peeled and finely chopped
1 tbsp maple syrup




Method


Place the potato cubes into a small pan of boiling salted water and boil for 6-7 minutes, or until the potato is tender. Drain well.


Return the drained potatoes to the pan. Add the butter, cream, salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste, and mash with a potato masher (or ricer) until smooth.


Spoon the mixture into dessertspoons and lay on a tray. Decorate each spoon with a little chopped pear and a drizzle of maple syrup and serve.
