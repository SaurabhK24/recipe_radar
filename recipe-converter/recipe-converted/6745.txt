By Hemsley + Hemsley






Ingredients

400g tin chickpeas, drained and rinsed
70-80g/2½- 2¾oz dates
1 tbsp vanilla extract
1 tbsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
1 free-range egg
3 pinches salt
1 tsp finely grated root ginger
1 large carrot (approximately 160g/5¼oz), grated




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Line a high-sided baking tray with baking parchment.


Blend all of the ingredients except the carrot in a food processor until smooth and well combined.


Add the carrot to the food processor and pulse a few times to combine, being careful not to over-blend (the carrot should provide texture and colour to this snack).


Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking tray, spreading and smoothing it into an even layer using a palette knife.


Bake in the oven for 30-35 minutes, or until cooked through and browned on top. Remove and set aside to cool slightly, then cut into squares. Serve warm or cold.
