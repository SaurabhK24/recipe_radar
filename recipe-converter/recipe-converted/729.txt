Dan Lepard's buttercream is firm and easy to pipe and decorate with. The baking margarine help the mixture to cream well without splitting and holds it firmer at room temperature than if only butter is used.






By Dan Lepard






Ingredients

300g/10½oz icing sugar
25g/1oz liquid glucose
50g/1¾oz condensed milk
2 tsp vanilla extract or other flavouring
200g/7oz unsalted butter, softened
100g/3½oz baking margarine, softened
200g/7oz icing sugar
100ml/3¾fl oz double cream
colouring and flavouring




Method


Mix the icing sugar, glucose, condensed milk, flavouring and butter with an electric mixer in a bowl until smooth and light, then beat in the baking margarine until smooth.


In a jug, stir the icing sugar into the cream until dissolved, then add any colouring or flavouring you want, or just leave it plain. Beat this gradually into the butter mixture until light and fluffy.


This buttercream keeps very well covered at room temperature for 2-3 days and can be warmed slightly and re-beaten if the texture is too firm.
