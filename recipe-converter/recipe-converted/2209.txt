Ingredients

3 chicken carcasses, plus 6 chicken legs
2.5 litres/4 pints 8fl oz water
3 carrots, peeled, chopped
2 celery stalks, trimmed, chopped
1 large leek, trimmed, sliced
2 large onions, peeled, chopped
2 fresh bay leaves
1 small bunch fresh thyme
1 tsp black peppercorns
1 tsp salt flakes
150g/5oz rice noodles
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
1-2 tbsp chopped fresh chives, to serve




Method


Place the chicken carcasses and drumsticks into a large deep pan and cover with the water. Add the carrots, celery, leek and onions.


Make a bouquet garni with the bay leaves and the thyme by tying the herbs together with kitchen string. Add the bouquet garni to the pan along with the peppercorns and salt.


Cover the pan with the lid and bring the mixture to the boil, then reduce the heat until it is simmering. Simmer for about two hours, skimming off any scum that rises to the surface of the liquid from time to time. Set aside to cool slightly, then strain the stock into a smaller pan. Pick the meat from the chicken drumsticks and add it to the strained broth.


When ready to serve the broth, bring it to a gentle simmer, then add the noodles. Cook the noodles according to packet instructions until tender, then stir in the chopped parsley.


Serve the chicken noodle soup in bowls with the chopped chives sprinkled over.
