Ingredients
For the caramelised plums

150g/5½oz caster sugar
75ml/2½fl oz water
4 plums, cut in half, stones removed

For the muffin

150g/5½oz butter
150g/5½oz caster sugar
2 free-range eggs
150g/5½oz self-raising flour
spash milk
200ml/7½fl oz double cream, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the caramelised plums, heat the sugar and water in a saucepan over a gentle heat until dissolved and bubbling. Boil for 8-10 minutes, or until the sugar has melted and formed a dark caramel.


Add the plums to the mixture and stir until completely coated in the caramel. Transfer the mixture to a small ovenproof dish.


For the muffin, cream the butter and sugar together in a bowl until pale and fluffy, then gradually beat in the eggs. Fold in the flour, adding a splash of milk, if necessary, to loosen the mixture.


Spoon the muffin batter onto the caramelised plums and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the muffin has risen and is golden-brown and a skewer inserted into the muffin comes out clean.
