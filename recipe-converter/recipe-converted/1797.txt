Ingredients
For the steak

150g/5½oz rib-eye steak
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the spicy wedges

2 tbsp olive oil
1 baking potato, cut into about 6 wedges
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
½ tsp dried chilli flakes
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 sprig fresh rosemary, roughly chopped

For the balsamic tomato

2 tbsp olive oil
½ beef tomato
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the steak, heat a griddle pan until hot. Rub the steak with the oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fry the steak for 2-5 minutes on either side, depending on how you like it cooked.


For the wedges, heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan and fry the potato wedges, garlic and chilli flakes until the potato starts to colour. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, add the rosemary and place the pan in the oven to cook for 12-15 minutes, or until the wedges are golden-brown and tender.


For the balsamic tomato, heat one tablespoon of oil in a small ovenproof frying pan. Add the tomato and fry cut-side down, until it begins to colour. Drizzle the remaining oil over the top, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper well and drizzle over the balsamic vinegar. Roast in the oven for 8-10 minutes.


To serve, place the steak on a serving plate with the wedges on one side and the balsamic tomato on the other.
