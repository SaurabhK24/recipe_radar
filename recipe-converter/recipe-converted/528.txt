Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
½ onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed to a paste in a mortar and pestle
1 vine tomato, seeds removed and chopped
2 tbsp white wine vinegar
1 tsp caster sugar
100g/3½oz dried tagliatelle, cooked according to packet instructions, drained
2 tbsp chopped fresh chives, to garnish




Method


Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and gently fry the onion and garlic for 2-3 minutes, or until softened. Stir in the chopped tomato, vinegar and sugar and cook for a further 3-4 minutes, or until the sugar has dissolved.


Using a stick blender, process the sauce until smooth, then stir in the cooked tagliatelle and heat through.


Transfer the pasta onto a serving plate and garnish with the chopped chives.
