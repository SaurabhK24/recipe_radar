Ingredients
For the salmon

2 tbsp olive oil
150g/5oz salmon fillet
1 lime, peeled and sliced
1 tsp brown sugar
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the peas

85g/3oz frozen peas
25g/1oz butter
1 lime, juice only
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the salmon, heat half of the olive oil in an ovenproof frying pan and fry the fish skin-side down for 2-3 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown. Lay the lime slices over the fish, sprinkle with the sugar, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and place into the oven to roast for 5-7 minutes, or until cooked through.


For the peas, cook the peas in boiling water for 2-3 minutes, or until tender. Drain, then mash with the butter and lime juice and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, spoon the mushy peas onto a serving plate and lay the salmon over the top.
