Ingredients

450g/1lb cherry tomatoes
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 garlic cloves, sliced
12 sprigs fresh thyme
250ml/9fl oz extra virgin olive oil
2 tbsp sherry vinegar

For the tapenade

250g/9oz green olives, stones removed
1 tbsp capers, rinsed and drained
1 lemon, juice only
1 garlic clove, chopped

For the toast

1 focaccia loaf, cut into 15cm/6in long strips
olive oil
handful fresh parmesan shavings




Method


Preheat the oven to 120C/250F/Gas ¼.


Place the tomatoes into a non-reactive baking dish and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Sprinkle over the garlic and thyme.


Drizzle over the oil and transfer to the oven to roast for one hour.


Remove from the oven, drizzle the tomatoes with the vinegar, then set aside.


For the tapenade, place the green olives, capers, lemon juice and garlic into a small blender and pulse to a rough paste.


For the toast, brush the focaccia strips with olive oil, then place onto a very hot griddle pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, until griddle lines appear on both sides.


To serve, place a strip of toast onto a plate and spread with a teaspoonful of tapenade. Repeat with the remaining toast strips until all of the tapenade is used up.


Top each toast strip with a spoonful of tomatoes and finish with parmesan shavings.
