A pasta carbonara with a special summer treat of fresh asparagus spears. Ready in no time, and such a luxury.

Ingredients

500g/1lb 2oz fettuccine
2 tbsp vegetable oil
300g/11oz smoked bacon or pancetta, cut into batons
1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
12 spears asparagus, blanched
3 large free-range eggs
1 tbsp olive oil
110g/4oz parmesan, freshly grated, plus extra, to serve
handful fresh parsley, chopped




Method


Bring a large pan of water to the boil. Add the fettuccine and cook according to packet instructions.


While the pasta is cooking, heat a large frying pan over a high heat and add the vegetable oil. Add the bacon and fry for 3-4 minutes, until golden-brown. Season with freshly ground black pepper.


Cut the asparagus into 3cm/1in pieces and add to the pan with the bacon. Cook for 1-2 minutes, just to warm through.


Break the eggs into a bowl and break the yolks with a fork.


Drain the cooked pasta and return to the pan it was cooked in. Retain a splash of the water the pasta was cooked in.


Add the bacon and asparagus mixture, including any cooking oils from the pan. Toss well to combine over a low heat. Cook for one minute, then add the egg, parmesan and the reserved cooking water and cook for 30 seconds to one minute, stirring constantly, until the egg is just cooked.


Add the chopped parsley and spoon equal portions into six bowls. Grate over a little extra parmesan and serve.
