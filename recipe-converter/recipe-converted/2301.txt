Ingredients
For the tuna steak

100g/3½oz caster sugar
60ml/2fl oz rice wine vinegar
2 lemongrass sticks, bruised
1 red chilli, finely sliced
2 tbsp finely sliced mint
2 tbsp finely sliced coriander
400g/14oz block fresh tuna

For the asparagus salad

8 asparagus spears, trimmed
½ bunch baby breakfast radishes, leaves removed and reserved
1 bunch baby turnips
½ bunch fresh watercress
2 tbsp fresh mint leaves, left whole
2 tbsp fresh coriander, left whole
2 tbsp baby coriander cress, to serve




Method


For the tuna steak, heat a griddle pan until hot.


Heat a frying pan and add the sugar, vinegar and 60ml/2fl oz of water. Once the sugar has dissolved, add the lemongrass, chilli, mint and coriander.


Cook for a couple of minutes until sticky and then roll the tuna in the glaze.


Place the tuna onto a griddle pan and cook until bar marks appear and turn the tuna around until you have marks all around the tuna. Make sure it is pink in the middle.


Once removed from the pan, brush the remaining glaze over the tuna. Allow to rest for a few minutes while you make the salad.


For the asparagus salad, heat a saucepan of boiling water and blanch the asparagus, radishes and turnips. Drain.


Place the vegetables in iced water to refresh.


Place the watercress, mint and coriander leaves in a large bowl. Add the blanched vegetables, along with the radish leaves and mix it all together.


To serve, cut the tuna into bite-size pieces and serve with the salad alongside. Garnish with baby coriander cress. Drizzle over any glaze that's left in the pan after cooking the tuna.
