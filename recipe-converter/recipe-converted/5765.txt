85g/3oz almond biscuits, crushed

110g/4oz mascarpone cheese
2 tbsp icing sugar
1 tbsp lemon juice

For the raspberry coulis

55g/2oz raspberries

Method


Mix the crushed biscuits and melted butter in a bowl.


Place a chefs' ring onto a serving plate. Press the biscuit mixture firmly into the ring.


In a bowl, mix together the mascarpone, icing sugar and lemon juice. Spoon the mixture into the ring and smooth off the top using a palette knife. Remove the ring.


To make the raspberry coulis, blend the raspberries, icing sugar and lime juice in a mini-food processor and pass through a sieve.


To serve, drizzle the coulis over the cheesecake and garnish with a sprig of mint.
