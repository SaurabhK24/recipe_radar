Ingredients

2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 large onion, finely chopped
olive oil
1 tsp powdered cumin
2 tins(400g/14oz) chopped tomatoes
340g/12oz sweetcorn kernels, tinned or frozen
1L/1 ¾pt vegetable or chicken stock
2 tbsp tomato purée
fresh basil or coriander leaves
salt and black pepper




Method


Sweat the garlic and onion in olive oil until soft and translucent. Add the cumin and cook for a minute or so before adding the tomatoes, sweetcorn, stock and tomato purée. Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat and allow to simmer for 15-20 minutes.


The soup is good just as it is, rustic and chunky. If you prefer a smoother soup, just blend half of the mixture. Scatter with fresh herbs and serve with a drizzle of olive oil. Season well.
