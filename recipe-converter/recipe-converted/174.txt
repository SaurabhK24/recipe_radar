Classic Mediterranean ingredients, olives, capers and anchovies, are combined to make this flavoursome dip. Choose whether you prefer a rough or smooth textured finish and serve with bread and crudit√© for dipping.

Ingredients

1 garlic clove, crushed
1 lemon, juice only
3 tbsp capers, chopped
6 anchovy fillets, chopped
250g/9oz black olives, pitted
small bunch fresh parsley, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2-4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil




Method


To make a rough textured tapenade, simply mix all the ingredients together, adding enough olive oil to form a paste.


For a smoother texture, tip the garlic, lemon juice, capers and anchovy into a food processor and process for about 10 seconds. Add the olives and parsley and enough olive oil to make a paste.


Season to taste if necessary.
