Mash is wonderful if made correctly. Use floury potatoes and do not under-cook them.

From Mary Berry Cooks






Ingredients

1.5kg/3lb 5oz floury potatoes (such as Desiree, King Edward or Maris Piper), peeled
50g/1¾oz butter
100ml/3½fl oz milk
salt and pepper
2 tbsp wholegrain mustard




Method


Cut the potatoes into even-sized small cubes and put them into a pan of cold, salted water. Bring to the boil and cook until really tender (the length of cooking depends on the size you cut them up).


Drain and return the potato cubes to the pan. Add the butter and milk. Mash using a potato masher, and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the wholegrain mustard.


Serve hot.
