Ingredients

3 yellow peppers
200g/7oz small plum tomatoes
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
6 tbsp of Italian extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for brushing
10 basil leaves, roughly chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
12 slices prosciutto
1 loaf ciabatta bread, about 30cm/12in long
parmesan cheese, for shaving




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/428F/Gas 7.


Place the whole yellow peppers on a baking tray and roast them for about half an hour.


Remove from the oven and immediately transfer them into a large bowl. Cover with cling film and leave covered until the peppers are cold. The steam will make it easier to peel the peppers.


Once cooled, peel off the skins, remove the seeds and slice. Place in a bowl.


Cut the tomatoes in half and mix with the roasted peppers, garlic, extra virgin olive oil and basil. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Place the slices of prosciutto on a baking tray and grill for 2-3 minutes on each side until crispy.


Cut the ciabatta loaf into three equal pieces and then cut each piece in half through the middle horizontally. Brush both sides with olive oil and toast them on a griddle pan until golden.


To serve the bruschetta, place two slices of crispy prosciutto on each piece of ciabatta. Divide the pepper and tomato mixture between each piece and top with shavings of parmesan.


Serve immediately.
