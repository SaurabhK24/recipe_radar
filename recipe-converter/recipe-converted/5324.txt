A naughty treat that's unbeatable when eaten warm and covered in sugar.

Ingredients
For the dough

500g/1lb 2oz strong white flour
50g/2oz caster sugar
40g/1½oz unsalted butter
2 free-range eggs
2 x 7g sachets instant yeast
10g/¼oz salt
150ml/5fl oz warm milk
130ml/4½fl oz water

For the filling

2 x jars strawberry jam




Method


For the dough, place all ingredients into a large bowl holding back a quarter of the water.


Stir with your hands until a dough is formed.


Slowly add the remaining water and knead the dough in the bowl for four minutes. (Alternatively, you could mix with a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook).


Tip dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead well for 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic.


Place the dough into a clean bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rise for an hour.


Tip the dough out onto a very lightly floured surface, and knock it back by kneading it a few times.


Divide the dough into 10 equal portions and shape each portion into a ball.


Place all balls onto a floured baking tray and allow to rise for an hour.


Preheat a deep fat fryer, filled with sunflower oil, to 180C/350F.


Lower each doughnut into the fryer, cooking each side for about five minutes or until golden brown. Remove the doughnuts from the oil with a slotted spoon and immediately roll in caster sugar so that the hot fat makes the sugar stick to the sides.


Set aside and leave to cool.


When completely cool, using a small, sharp, knife make a cut into the side of the doughnut, reaching to the centre.


Spoon some smooth or sieved strawberry jam into a piping bag, or piping syringe.


Pipe, or syringe, the jam generously inside.
