Apple compôte is a great way to use up a glut of apples, and makes a delicious breakfast or healthy dessert.






By Michael Caines


From Saturday Kitchen






Ingredients

100g/3½oz unsalted butter
750g/1lb 10oz Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and chopped
100g/3½oz caster sugar
1 vanilla pod split




Method


Place the butter in a stainless steel saucepan and start to melt.


Add the apples, sugar and vanilla pod.


Cook out the apple to a compote, stirring from time to time for approximately 30 minutes on a moderate heat.


If the texture is too runny then leave to reduce until you have a thick texture.


Remove the vanilla pod, and reserve for use later.


Place the apple compote into a blender, blend to a fine pulp and pass through a fine sieve. Serve.
