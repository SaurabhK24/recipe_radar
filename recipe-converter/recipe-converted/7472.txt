400g/14oz peas
350ml/12fl oz chicken stock or vegetable stock
150ml/5fl oz double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 lime, zest only

Method


Heat a pan until hot, then add the butter and shallots and fry over a low heat for 2-3 minutes, until the shallots have softened but not coloured.


Add the peas and stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 2-3 minutes.


Allow the soup to cool for a few minutes, then carefully pour into a food processor and blend to a smooth purée. Return the soup to the saucepan.


Add 110ml/4fl oz of the cream, and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Place the remaining cream into a bowl and whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed.


Fold in the lime zest and mint.


Spoon the soup into serving bowls and add a spoonful of the lime and mint cream to the middle.
