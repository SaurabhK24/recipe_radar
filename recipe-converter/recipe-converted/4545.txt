Ingredients

450g/1lb frozen petit pois or peas, defrosted and drained
½ red onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
1 small bunch fresh mint leaves
115g/4oz plain yoghurt
½ red chilli, seeds removed, finely chopped
1 tsp ground cumin
½ tsp ground coriander
1 lime, juice only
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 large bag ready-made nachos




Method


Place the peas, onion, garlic and mint leaves into a food processor and blend to a thick purée.


Add the yoghurt and blend again, leaving the mixture slightly lumpy.


Transfer the mixture to a bowl and stir in the chilli, cumin, coriander and lime juice and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Spoon into a serving bowl and drizzle with the olive oil. Serve with a bowl of nachos alongside for dipping.
