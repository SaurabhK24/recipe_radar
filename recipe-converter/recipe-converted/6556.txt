Ingredients
For the compote

½ bottle red wine
1 orange, juice and zest
250g/9oz mixed dried fruit
100g/3½oz caster sugar
1 tsp mixed spice
1 tsp cornflour
25ml/1fl oz water

For the caramelised chestnuts

100g/3½oz caster sugar
150g/5½oz roasted chestnuts
½ lemon, juice only




Method


For the compote, place the wine, orange juice and zest, dried fruit, sugar and spice into a pan and cook for six minutes.


Place the cornflour and the water into a separate bowl and mix the ingredients until the mixture is smooth.


Add the cornflour mixture to the compote and stir until the texture of the sauce has thickened.


For the caramelised chestnuts, heat the sugar in a frying pan over a gentle heat, until the sugar has melted to create a smooth caramel. Add the chestnuts to the caramel and mix well to coat them. Then pour in the lemon juice and mix well. Then pour the mixture onto a greased non-stick baking sheet.


To serve, place the compote into a clean bowl. Sprinkle some of the chestnuts on top of the compote.
