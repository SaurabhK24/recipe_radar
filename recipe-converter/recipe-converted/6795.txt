Ingredients

500g/1lb 2oz unbleached strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting
1 tsp salt
2 tsp dried yeast
300ml/10fl oz warm water
4 tbsp onion marmalade




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.


Put the flour, salt and yeast in a mixer with a dough hook attachment and mix. Gradually add the water until it forms a dough then knead in the processor 5-8 minutes.


Leave to rise for at least an hour. Then knock the dough back and knead in the marmalade.


Grease 8 clean clay flowerpots with butter and line them with baking parchment. Divide the dough into 8 pieces and put it in the flowerpots. Leave to prove again for 30 minutes.


Place the flowerpots on a baking tray and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until golden-brown and cooked through.
