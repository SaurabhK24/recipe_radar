Ingredients
For the chicken

150g/5½oz chicken breast
25g/1oz Stilton
2 slices smoked back bacon
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the mash

½ butternut squash, peeled, seeds removed, chopped, boiled until soft and drained
50g/1¾oz Stilton
50ml/2fl oz double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the chicken, make an incision to the chicken breast lengthways to create a pocket.


Place the Stilton into the pocket then wrap the breast with the bacon rashers.


Rub the bacon-wrapped breast with the olive oil and season both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Heat an ovenproof frying pan over a high heat. Add the bacon-wrapped chicken and pan fry for one minute on each side until browned.


Transfer to the oven and roast for 12-15 minutes, or until the chicken is completely cooked through.


To make the mash, mash the cooked butternut squash using a potato masher or a ricer.


Add the cream and Stilton, mix together well and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, place the mashed butternut squash in the middle of a large warmed plate and place the chicken on top.
