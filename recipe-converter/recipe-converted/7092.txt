Ingredients
For the pan-fried hoki

200g/7oz hoki
1 egg, beaten
100g/3½oz fresh breadcrumbs
2 tbsp chopped mixed fresh herbs, (basil, parsley, chives)
1 tbsp olive oil

For the Brie and sweet potato sauce

2 tsp olive oil
1 shallot, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
¼ sweet potato, peeled, finely chopped and boiled until soft
75g/2½oz Brie, chopped
1 tbsp double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Heat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Roll the hoki in the beaten egg, then in the breadcrumbs and then in the mixed chopped herbs. Pat with hands to secure the herbs.


Heat the olive oil and pan fry the fish for two minutes on each side. Place on a baking tray in the oven and roast for five minutes or until cooked through.


To make the sauce, heat the oil, add the shallot and garlic and cook gently for two minutes. Add the sweet potato and cook for another minute, stirring well. Add the Brie and double cream, stir to combine and season well. Cook for two minutes.


To serve, place the hoki on a plate and spoon over the sauce.
