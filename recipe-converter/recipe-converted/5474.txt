Ingredients
For the lamb chops

12 French-trimmed lamb chops
125ml/4½fl oz extra virgin olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the butter bean gratin

1 red onion, finely chopped
4 salted anchovy fillets, chopped
8 tomatoes, chopped
450g/1lb can butter beans, drained, rinsed
100g/3½oz peas, fresh or frozen
1 tbsp fresh mint, finely chopped
1 tbsp sherry vinegar

For the topping

75g/2½oz parmesan, finely grated
100g/3½oz butter




Method


Preheat the grill to high.


Rub the olive oil over the lamb chops and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Heat a griddle pan until hot and grill the lamb chops for two minutes on each side. Remove from the pan and keep warm


For the gratin, heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a frying pan and gently fry the onion on a medium heat for five minutes, or until soft.


Add the anchovy, tomatoes, butter beans, peas, mint, sherry vinegar and the remaining olive oil and simmer for a further five minutes.


Spoon the butter bean mixture into the ramekins


To make the topping, mix the breadcrumbs, parmesan and butter together until well combined. Sprinkle over the beans and place under the grill for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown.


Serve with the lamb chops alongside the butter bean gratin.
