Courgette in cake? Absolutely. It's deliciously green, healthy and very easy to bake with children.



Ingredients

vegetable oil, for greasing
50g/2oz soft brown sugar
50g/2oz soft butter
1 egg
60g/2oz courgette
90g/3¼oz self-raising flour
1 tsp mixed spice
half a lime, juice only




Method


Before cooking, wash your hands and put on an apron. Weigh and measure all the ingredients. Ask a grown-up to preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7. Grease a small (500g) loaf tin with a little vegetable oil using a pastry brush.


Place the sugar and butter into a mixing bowl. Using the back of a fork mash the ingredients together until completely combined.


Break the egg into a cup and whisk with a fork. Add the egg to the sugar and butter and stir.


Grate the courgette and add this to the mixture with the flour, mixed spice and lime juice and stir using a wooden spoon.


Put the mixture into the prepared loaf tin. Ask a grown-up to put it in the oven for 20–25 minutes until golden-brown on the top. Serve in slices with some fresh fruit.
