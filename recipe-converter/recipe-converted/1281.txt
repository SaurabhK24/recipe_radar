Ingredients
For the cod

2 heaped tbsp Za’atar
4 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for frying
400g/14oz prime cod fillet or loin (or a different firm white fish), cut in to 4 pieces
sea salt

For the relish

24 Kalamata olives, stones removed
6 preserved lemons, halved and roughly chopped
8 pickled chillies, thinly sliced
1 small bunch of coriander, roughly chopped
olive oil




Method


Mix the za’atar with the olive oil in a small bowl to create a paste. Smear this paste over the cod pieces, ensuring they are well coated. Season each piece of fish with a pinch of salt. Place in a non-reactive container and leave to marinade in the fridge for 30 minutes.


For the relish, place all the ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Do not season the mixture with salt as it will already have a salty taste.


Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat, then drizzle in a generous amount of olive oil.


Fry the cod for about 8 minutes on one side and 3-4 minutes on the other side. The cod should be golden-brown with a nice spice crusting.


Serve the cod with a generous helping of the relish.




Recipe Tips
To infuse the cod with more flavour you can allow it to marinade for longer than half an hour if you have time. You could marinade it overnight to make this a speedy supper for the following day.
