Ingredients
For the ragu

2 tbsp olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, chopped
1 tsp smoked paprika
150g/5oz Quorn pieces
150ml/5fl oz white wine
150ml/5fl oz double cream
85g/3oz cherry tomatoes, halved

For the dumplings

150g/5oz self-raising flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 tbsp olive oil
75ml/2½fl oz milk
85g/3oz Double Gloucester cheese, grated




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/360F/Gas 4.


For the ragu, heat the oil in a pan and gently fry the onion and garlic for 4-5 minutes, until soft.


Add the smoked paprika and Quorn pieces and stir well. Continue to fry for 5-7 minutes, then add the wine and bring to the boil.


Add the cream and tomato halves and simmer for 3-4 minutes.


For the dumplings, place the flour, baking powder, oil and enough milk to bind the mix into a food processor and pulse until just coming together as a dough.


Add the cheese and pulse again to just combine.


Roll pieces of the mix into balls about the size of a tangerine, then place them onto a baking sheet. Press the dough balls down slightly, then transfer to the oven to bake for 8-10 minutes, or until golden-brown.


To serve, place the ragu into a serving bowl with the dumplings alongside.
