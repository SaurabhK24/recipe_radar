These little yoghurt jellies are sweetened with no-added-sugar cordial and will hit the spot if you are used to finishing a meal with dessert. The yoghurt brings extra protein and the jellies are topped with mixed berries for fibre. Leaf gelatine is very simple to use and easily available – so give it a go.

  With a GI of 39 this meal is high protein, low GI and provides 42 kcal per portion.

Ingredients

4 sheets leaf gelatine
6 tbsp sugar-free lemon or orange squash
½ lemon, zest only, finely grated
150g/5½oz fat-free natural yoghurt
200g/7oz mixed fresh berries (alternatively use frozen berries)
small handful fresh mint leaves




Method


Put the gelatine sheets in a medium bowl and cover with cold water. Leave to soak for five minutes or until they soften. Turn them a couple of times to make sure they don’t stick together.


Pour the squash, lemon zest and 100ml/3½fl oz of water into a small saucepan and heat very gently until just warm. Remove from the heat.


Squeeze the gelatine sheets to remove excess water and then add to the pan, stirring until it melts in to the liquid.


Stir in 250ml/9fl oz water and the yoghurt until they are thoroughly combined.


Pour the jelly into four glass tumblers or dishes, cover with cling film and chill for 5-6 hours or overnight until set.


Serve the jellies topped with fresh berries and mint leaves to decorate.
