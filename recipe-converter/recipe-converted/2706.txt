This porridge is made with water and skimmed milk to keep the calories low. A little ground cinnamon makes it taste sweeter without adding calories and it is topped with juicy grated pear.

Ingredients

60g/2¼oz jumbo porridge oats
¼ tsp ground cinnamon, plus a little to sprinkle
300ml/10fl oz semi-skimmed milk
1 ripe medium pear
1 wedge lemon




Method


Put the oats and cinnamon in a non-stick saucepan with the milk and cook over a low-medium heat for 4-5 minutes, stirring constantly until rich and creamy. Pour into two deep bowls.


Coarsely grate the pear, and place on top of the porridge. Squeeze over the lemon juice and sprinkle with a tiny pinch of ground cinnamon.




Recipe Tips
It's important to use jumbo oats, rather than instant oats, because they take longer to digest.
