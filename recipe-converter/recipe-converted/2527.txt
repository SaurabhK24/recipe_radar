Ingredients
For the chocolate crêpes

55g/2oz self-raising flour
55g/2oz cocoa powder
1 tbsp caster sugar
2 free-range eggs
100ml/3½fl oz milk
25g/1oz butter

For the mango soufflé

½ mango, stone removed, peeled, flesh chopped
1 tbsp caster sugar
1 tsp cornflour
2 free-range egg whites, whisked until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed
icing sugar, for dusting




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the chocolate crêpes, mix the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, eggs and half of the milk in a bowl. Add the rest of the milk little by little as necessary until the batter has the consistency of double cream.


Heat the butter in a frying pan over a high heat until it is foaming. Add a ladleful of the batter mixture to the hot pan, swirl the pan to spread the mixture evenly over the bottom of the pan, and fry the crêpe on both sides for 1-2 minutes until golden-brown. Repeat with the second crêpe. Set aside.


For the mango soufflé, blend the mango flesh and sugar in a food processor to a purée.


Place the mango mixture into a saucepan over a medium heat. Stir in the cornflour and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the mixture has thickened.


Fold the hot mango mixture into the whisked egg whites.


Spoon the mango soufflé mixture into the centre of the crêpes and fold the edges of each crêpe over. Place the crêpes into a gratin dish. Transfer to the oven and cook for 4-5 minutes.


To serve, dust the crêpes with icing sugar using a sieve.
