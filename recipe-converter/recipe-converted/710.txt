Ingredients

100g/3½oz shallots, peeled, very thinly sliced
¼ tsp salt, or to taste
350g/12¼oz cold, cooked leftover turkey meat, sliced into strips
400g/14¼oz Chinese cabbage, core removed, leaves finely shredded
100g/3½oz beansprouts
1 large carrot, peeled, cut in half, finely shredded
15g/½oz Vietnamese mint leaves (available from some Asian grocers), or a mixture of coriander and mint or Thai sweet basil leaves, roughly chopped
40g/1½oz roasted peanuts, coarsely chopped, plus extra to serve
freshly ground black pepper

For the dressing

3 tbsp fish sauce (nam pla)
3 tbsp freshly squeezed lime juice
1 tbsp rice vinegar
2 tbsp caster sugar
1 tsp very finely chopped garlic
2 red bird's-eye chillies, finely chopped




Method


Mix the shallots and salt in a large bowl and set aside for 30 minutes, or until softened.


Meanwhile, for the dressing, mix together the dressing ingredients in a separate bowl until well combined.


Just before serving, add the cold turkey strips to the bowl of salted shallots. Mix in the Chinese cabbage leaves, beansprouts, shredded carrot, herbs and peanuts until well combined.


Pour over the dressing, season, to taste, with freshly ground black pepper, then mix well until the dressing coats the salad ingredients.


To serve, pile the turkey salad into the centre of each of four serving plates. Sprinkle over the remaining chopped roasted peanuts.
