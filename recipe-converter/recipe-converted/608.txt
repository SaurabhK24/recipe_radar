Ingredients
For the trout

4 rainbow trout, cleaned, gutted and butterflied (ask your fishmonger to do this)
salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 scallops, cleaned
150ml/5fl oz double cream
½ lemon, juiced
50g/2oz butter

For the beurre noisette

110g/4oz unsalted butter
½ lemon, juice only
4 tbsp toasted flaked almonds
2 tbsp flat leaf parsley, roughly chopped




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


For the trout, season the inside of the trout with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Place the scallops into a food processor and blend to a purée. Add the double cream and lemon juice and pulse until thickened.


Season the scallop mixture with salt and black pepper then spoon or pipe into the cavity of the trout. Press the trout down gently to close.


Heat the butter in a frying pan over a medium to high heat. When the butter is foaming, add the trout and fry for 1-2 minutes on each side.


Transfer the trout to a baking tray and bake for another 4-5 minutes to finish cooking through.


Remove and set aside to rest for one minute then peel off the skin, leaving the head on.


For the beurre noisette, heat a frying pan until hot, add the butter and heat until it turns a nut-brown colour.


Add the lemon juice, toasted almonds, parsley and a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper and then remove from the heat.


To serve, place each trout onto a plate and spoon over the beurre noisette.
