Ingredients

50g/1¾oz breadcrumbs
handful fresh thyme, chopped
handful fresh tarragon, chopped
1 free-range egg, beaten
100g/3½oz Camembert, cut into triangles
oil for deep frying

For the sauce

1 tbsp olive oil
½ Romero pepper, sliced
pinch chilli flakes
1 clove garlic, crushed
35g/1¼oz breadcrumbs




Method


In a bowl, mix the breadcrumbs together with the herbs.


Dip the Camembert into the egg and then place into the herbed crumb.


Heat the oil in a deep heavy-bottomed pan. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be very dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


When the oil is hot deep-fry the breaded Camembert for 2-3 minutes or until crisp and golden. Remove from the pan and drain on kitchen paper.


For the sauce, sauté the pepper, chilli flakes, garlic and breadcrumbs for 2-4 minutes or until softened. Blend in a food processor until smooth. You may need some water to loosen it.


Serve the deep fried cheese with the red pepper sauce.
