Ingredients
For the grain mustard vinaigrette

2 tbsp wholegrain mustard
50ml/2fl oz white wine vinegar
50ml/2fl oz water
2 tbsp olive oil
salt and ground white pepper, to taste
small handful fresh tarragon, chopped

For the salad

100g/3½oz mixed leaf salad
small bunch fresh mixed herbs (chervil, basil and chives), chopped roughly
2 shallots, chopped finely

For the scallops

olive oil, to cook
8 large or 12 small scallops removed from shells, cleaned and halved
salt and freshly ground black pepper
½ lemon, juice only




Method


For the vinaigrette, place the mustard into a bowl and whisk in the vinegar, water and olive oil. Season with salt and white pepper. Use a hand blender to mix thoroughly until thickened and emulsified. Add the chopped tarragon.


For the salad, place the mixed leaves, herbs and shallots into a bowl and gently toss. Dress the salad lightly with the vinaigrette just before cooking the scallops.


For the scallops, heat a little olive oil in a non-stick pan over a medium heat. Season the scallops with salt and freshly ground black pepper before placing into the pan sliced-side down and cook until golden-brown, about 1-2 minutes. Turn the scallops over and reduce the heat. Cook for a further 1-3 minutes, depending on their size, or until just cooked. Take care not to overcook the scallops.


Remove the scallops from the pan and place onto a tray lined with kitchen paper. Squeeze over the lemon juice.


To serve, place a little of the dressed salad onto four plates. Place the scallops on and around the salad. Finish by drizzling some of the grain mustard vinaigrette around the plate.
