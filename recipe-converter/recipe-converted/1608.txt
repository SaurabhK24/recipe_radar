Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Place the filo sheets onto a baking tray, place into the oven and bake for five minutes or until crisp.


Meanwhile, melt the sugar in a frying pan over a high heat until golden brown. Add the apple and orange and cook for five minutes, stirring to coat.


Mix the yoghurt with the lemon zest, lemon juice and maple syrup in a clean bowl.


Once the filo is cooked, remove from the oven and carefully layer the pastry sheets with the yoghurt mixture and caramelised fruits, to create a series of sandwiched layers
