Ingredients
For the chilli-poached salmon

150ml/¼ pint olive oil
150ml/¼ pint vegetable oil
1 tsp chilli flakes
4 cloves
2 cardamom pods, lightly crushed
1 x 100g/3½oz salmon fillet, skin removed

For the sauce

1 tbsp olive oil
¼ onion, chopped
1 tsp chilli flakes
200g/7oz canned cherry tomatoes
1 tbsp chopped fresh basil leaves
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the chilli-poached salmon, heat the oils and spices in a heavy-based saucepan over a medium heat.


Add the fish and poach for 8-10 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


For the sauce, heat the oil in a frying pan and gently fry the onion until softened but not coloured.


Add the chilli flakes and tomatoes and simmer for 2-3 minutes, until slightly thickened. Add the basil leaves, season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir.


To serve, place the fish onto a serving plate and drizzle over the sauce.
