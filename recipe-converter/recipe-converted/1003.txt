Ingredients

250g/9oz bulgar wheat
1 bay leaf
50g/2oz red onion, finely sliced
500ml/1 pint chicken stock (vegetarians can substitute vegetable stock)
2 garlic cloves, chopped
50g/2oz sunblushed tomatoes
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Place all of the ingredients into a large saucepan over a high heat. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for five minutes.


Cut out a piece of greaseproof paper slightly larger than the pan. Place under the tap to wet slightly, then crumple it up and place inside the pan to cover the contents. Transfer to the oven to cook for ten minutes.
