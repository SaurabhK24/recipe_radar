It’s definitely worth the effort of making your own stuffing for Christmas dinner, and Mary Berry’s version is a winner.

Ingredients

600ml/1 pint water
1 large onion, coarsely chopped
225g/8oz pre-soaked dried apricots, snipped into small pieces
225g/9oz fresh white breadcrumbs
75g/3oz butter
225g/8oz frozen chestnuts, thawed, roughly chopped
generous bunch fresh parsley, chopped
salt
freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat oven 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Butter a shallow ovenproof dish.


Measure the water into a pan; add the onion and apricot bring to the boil.


Boil for about five minutes and drain.


Put the breadcrumbs into a large bowl.


Melt the butter in a pan and pour half of this onto the breadcrumbs.


Add the remaining butter to a frying pan and fry the chestnuts over a high heat until lightly browned.


Tip into the bowl with the breadcrumbs.


Add the apricots, onion and parsley to the bowl.


Season with salt and pepper.


Turn into a buttered, shallow ovenproof dish and bake in a preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes until crisp and hot right through.


To freeze: cool and cover the dish with foil, freeze until Christmas Eve.


To thaw: take out the night before using and thaw overnight. Re-crispen in a hot oven (as above) for about 10-15 minutes.
