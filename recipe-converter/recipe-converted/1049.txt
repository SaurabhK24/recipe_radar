Ingredients
For the salmon

25g/1oz butter
150g/5½oz salmon fillet
1 orange, quartered
1 lemon, juice only
pinch cinnamon
pinch chilli flakes
1 tsp brown sugar
1 tsp balsamic vinegar
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the salad

150g/ 5½oz spinach
2 tbsp olive oil
½ lemon, juice only




Method


For the salmon, melt the butter in a small frying pan, place the salmon into the pan along with all the other salmon ingredients and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until completely cooked through. Remove the salmon from the pan and flake into pieces.


Return the frying pan to the heat and simmer the sauce left in the pan for 4-5 minutes, until reduced, squeezing out the juice from the orange quarters with the back of a spoon.


For the salad, place the spinach, olive oil and lemon juice into a large bowl and mix well.


To serve, place the salad onto a plate, top with the flaked salmon and pour over the sauce from the pan.
