Ingredients

25g/1oz butter
½ onion, finely chopped
1-2 parsnips, peeled, finely chopped
300ml/10½fl oz hot vegetable stock
2 tbsp grated hard goats' cheese
2 tsp curry powder
3 tbsp double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp Greek-style yoghurt
drizzle olive oil




Method


Melt the butter in a saucepan and fry the onion until softened but not coloured. Add the parsnip, pour in the stock and cook for 6-8 minutes, or until the parsnip is tender.


Add the goats' cheese and curry powder and cook for 3-4 minutes. Stir in the double cream and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then blend with a hand-held blender until smooth. Add a dash of boiling water if the soup is too thick.


Pour into a bowl and garnish with a dollop of Greek-style yoghurt and a drizzle of olive oil.
