Ingredients
For the gulab jamun

vegetable oil, for deep frying
225g/8oz powdered milk
110g/4oz plain flour
1¼ tsp baking powder
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
350ml/12fl oz double cream
25g/1oz butter, melted

For the syrup

75ml/3fl oz water
200g/7oz caster sugar
1 lemon, juice only

To serve

150g/5oz strawberries, hulled
150g/5oz raspberries
4 tbsp icing sugar




Method


Preheat the vegetable oil in a deep fat fryer to 170C/350F.


Place the milk powder, flour, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda into a bowl and mix to combine.


Add 100ml/3½fl oz the cream and mix well.


Add the butter and as much extra cream as necessary to form a soft, slightly sticky dough.


Roll the dough into small balls and carefully place into the deep fat fryer. Fry for 2-3 minutes until golden and completely cooked through. Carefully remove the cooked balls with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


For the syrup, place the water, sugar and lemon juice into a pan over a medium heat and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 1-2 minutes.


Carefully place the jamun balls into the syrup and roll around to completely coat. Remove from the heat and leave to absorb the syrup for ten minutes.


To serve, place the strawberries and raspberries into a bowl and sprinkle with the icing sugar, stirring gently to coat evenly.


Place the strawberries and raspberries onto a large serving dish and top with the gulab jamun.
