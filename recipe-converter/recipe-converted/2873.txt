Ingredients

200ml/7fl oz whole milk
1 tbsp instant coffee granules
2 tbsp caster sugar
2 free-range eggs, beaten
3 slices white bread
100g/3½oz dates
icing sugar, for dusting




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Heat the milk in a saucepan over a low heat and stir in the coffee granules. Stir for 2-3 minutes, or until the granules have dissolved. Remove from the heat and whisk in the sugar and eggs, until well combined.


Using a small ring cutter the size of a ramekin, cut out six circles of bread and soak them in the milk and coffee mixture in the pan.


Press a soaked bread piece into the bottom of each of two ramekins. Next, place a handful of the dates on top, followed by another slice of the bread. Continue layering the dates and bread and finally pour over any excess milk and egg mixture on top of the two puddings.


Bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until set.


To serve, dust the puddings with icing sugar and serve immediately.
