Ingredients
For the biscuits

225g/8oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting
225g/8oz self-raising flour
1 tsp table salt
1 tsp caster sugar
85g/3oz lightly salted butter, plus extra to serve
85g/3oz lard




Method


For the biscuits, preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


In a bowl, mix the dry ingredients together. Rub in butter and lard so that mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.


Add just enough cold water to bring the mixture together to form a stiff dough (about 5-6 tablespoons). Refrigerate for 15-20 minutes.


On a lightly floured worksurface, roll out the dough to a thickness just less than a £1 coin.


Using a 9cm/3½in round cutter cut out biscuits from the dough. Prick the top of the biscuits all over to decorate, leaving a plain 5mm/¼in border around the edge.


Transfer to wire racks or baking mesh. Place the racks/mesh on baking trays and bake for 14-16 minutes, or until the biscuits are dry but not browned. Set aside to cool completely.


Serve the biscuits with chilled butter.
