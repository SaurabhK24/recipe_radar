Ingredients

570ml/1 pint sherry or white wine
½ grated nutmeg
sugar to taste
900ml/1½pt milk




Method


Put the wine into a bowl, with the grated nutmeg and plenty of pounded sugar, and add it to the milk.


Clouted cream may be held on the top, with pounded cinnamon or nutmeg and sugar; and a little brandy may be added to the wine before the milk is put in.


In some countries, cider is substituted for the wine: when this is used, brandy must always be added. Warm milk may be poured on from a spouted jug or teapot; but it must be held very high.
