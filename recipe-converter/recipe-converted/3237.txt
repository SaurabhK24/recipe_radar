This is a quick vegetarian dish, perfect for a midweek supper. To make the tomato sauce extra special use San Marzano tomatoes.



Ingredients
For the tomato sauce

4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
400g can chopped tomatoes, preferably San Marzano
2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
1 tsp dried oregano
1 large handful fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the crispy aubergine and mozzarella

25g/1oz Parmesan cheese (or alternative vegetarian hard cheese), grated
100g/3½oz breadcrumbs
2 aubergines, topped and tailed and sliced long ways
2 balls of mozzarella, sliced
100g/3½oz plain flour
2 eggs, beaten
vegetable oil, for frying




Method


For the tomato sauce, heat a frying pan over a medium-high heat and add the olive oil, tomatoes, garlic and dried oregano. Simmer for 3-4 minutes, or until the tomatoes have just started to break down. Stir in the basil and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Keep warm.


Mix the Parmesan with the breadcrumbs. Coat the aubergine and mozzarella in flour, dip in the beaten egg and roll in the breadcrumbs.


Heat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan, once hot add the aubergine and mozzarella in batches and fry on each side for 2-3 minutes until crisp.


Place the aubergine and mozzarella on to plates and spoon the sauce over.
