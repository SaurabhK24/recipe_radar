Ingredients

1kg/2¼lb eating apples, peeled, cored and sliced
½ tsp cinnamon
good pinch mixed spice
1 packet puff pastry
lemon
1 egg
4 tbsp clear honey
30g/1oz melted butter
3 tbsp caster sugar




Method


Tip half the apples into a pan with the cinnamon and mixed spice, add a squeeze of lemon juice. Cook for 10-15 minutes on a medium heat until the apples are soft, stirring to make sure the apples do not stick to the pan (add a splash of water, cider or apple juice if necessary). Add sugar to taste if you think it is required.


Roll out the pastry to form a square and cut into quarters. Score a 1cm/½in frame around each piece and dock the centre in several places with the point of a sharp knife. Spread a spoonful of the purée into the centre of each square, taking care not to go over the edges of the frame as this will prevent the pastry rising properly. Top with the remaining apple slices.


Brush the frame with beaten egg and drizzle the apples with honey, butter and sugar.


Bake at 190C/375F/Gas 5 for 12-15 minutes until the tarts are crisp and caramelised.
