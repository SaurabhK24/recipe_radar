Ingredients

1 tsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing
200g/7oz tinned chopped tomatoes
1 fresh lasagne sheet, cut in half
6 fresh basil leaves
1 slice ham
¼ ball fresh mozzarella
100g/3½ oz ricotta




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease a small lidded ovenproof dish with a little olive oil.


Spoon a little chopped tomato into the dish and spread it over the bottom. Add half the lasagne sheet and cover with a little more chopped tomato, making sure it covers the sheet of lasagne.


Tear half of the basil leaves and half of the ham into small pieces and sprinkle on top.


Tear half of the mozzarella over the top, then dot small spoonfuls of half of the ricotta on top as well and season with freshly ground black pepper.


Repeat the layering process with the remaining ingredients: lasagne, tomatoes, basil, ham, ricotta and mozzarella. Then drizzle over the olive oil.


Cover with the lid and bake for 10 minutes, then remove the lid and cook for a further 10-12 minutes or until cooked through and golden-brown on top.
