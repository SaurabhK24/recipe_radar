Ingredients

25g/1oz butter
2 tsp oil
400g/14oz basmati rice
750m/1¼ pint boiling water
2 tsp salt
pinch of saffron soaked in a little warm water
30g/1¼oz soaked raisins (optional)




Method


Heat the butter and oil in a deep saucepan until they start to foam. Add the rice and stir until all the grains are coated. Pour in the boiling water and stir. Add the salt and the saffron. Bring the water back to the boil. Add the raisins.


Reduce the heat to a very gentle simmer and cover the pan with a tight fitting lid. Cook until all the water has been absorbed (about 20 minutes). Turn off the heat and leave the rice to stand for 5 minutes before serving.




Recipe Tips
When you have weighed the dry rice pour it into a sieve or fine colander and rinse it under a cold tap until the water runs almost clear. This will rinse the starch from the outside of the grains and prevent the rice from sticking together.
