Ingredients

175g/6oz caster sugar
150ml/5fl oz water
1 vanilla pod, split
100g/3½oz blueberries
100g/3½oz strawberries, quartered
100g/3½oz raspberries
12 slices white bread, crusts removed

To serve

icing sugar, for dusting
clotted cream (optional)




Method


Place the sugar, water and vanilla pod into a pan over a high heat. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 8-10 minutes.


Add all of the berries and remove from the heat. Allow to cool.


Strain the fruit mixture over a bowl. Place the drained berries into a separate bowl and reserve the fruit syrup.


Cut each slice of bread in half and dip the pieces into the fruit syrup.


Use the syrup-soaked bread to line the insides of four small dariole moulds.


Spoon some of the reserved berries into each bread-lined mould, to fill by one third.


Add a layer of syrup-soaked bread, then spoon in more berries and top with a final layer of syrup-soaked bread.


Place into the fridge to chill overnight.


To serve, turn out the puddings from the moulds onto plates and dust with icing sugar. Add a dollop of clotted cream alongside, if using, then serve.
