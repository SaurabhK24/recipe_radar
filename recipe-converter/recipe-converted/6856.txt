Ingredients
For the orange and apricot

2 oranges, peeled and segmented
2 fresh apricots, stones removed, chopped
2 tbsp honey

For the champagne sabayon

2 free-range egg yolks
1 vanilla pod, seeds only
3 tbsp champagne
2 tsp caster sugar




Method


Preheat the grill to medium-high.


For the grilled orange and apricot, place the segmented oranges and chopped apricots into a small ovenproof dish. Drizzle over the honey and place under the grill for 3-4 minutes, or until the fruit is hot and the honey is bubbling. Set aside while you make the sabayon.


For the sabayon, place the egg yolks into a heatproof bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water. Add the vanilla seeds, champagne and sugar and whisk until the mixture thickens.


To serve, pour the sabayon over the fruit.
