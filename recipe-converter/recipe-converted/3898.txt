Ingredients

4 mackerel, each weighing about 175-225g/6-8oz
450g/1lb new potatoes
1 small bunch of fresh dill, chopped, stalks reserved
50g/2oz seasoned flour
25ml/1fl oz vegetable oil
25g/1oz unsalted butter
1 lemon
salt




Method


Either ask your fishmonger to fillet the mackerel for you or fillet yourself.


Boil the new potatoes in a pan of well-salted water with the dill stalks.


Dust the fillets in the seasoned flour and shake off any excess. Heat the oil in a frying pan and add a knob of the butter. Fry the mackerel for 3 minutes on each side then remove from the pan and keep warm.


Pour away the fish-frying oil and butter. Add the rest of the butter to the pan and heat until it smells nutty. Squeeze the juice of half the lemon into the pan then pour over the fillets. Season the mackerel with salt, sprinkle over the dill and serve with the remaining half of the lemon wedges.
