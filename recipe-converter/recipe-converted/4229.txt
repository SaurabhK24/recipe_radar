Ingredients

60g/2½ canned borlotti beans, drained and rinsed
1 celery stalk, trimmed, chopped
1 spring onion, trimmed, sliced
50g/2oz cooked bacon, chopped
1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed
pinch dried chilli flakes
25g/1oz tomato purée
pinch stock or bouillon powder
250ml/9fl oz water




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Spoon the borlotti beans into a lidded ovenproof dish and squash with the back of a spoon to loosen the skins. Add the celery, spring onion, bacon pieces and garlic. Stir in the chilli flakes and the tomato purée.


Pour over the water, add the stock powder or bouillon and stir again until well combined. Cover the dish with the lid.


Transfer the dish to the oven and cook for 25-30 minutes, or until the soup has thickened. Stir well before serving in soup bowls with bread and butter on the side, if desired.
