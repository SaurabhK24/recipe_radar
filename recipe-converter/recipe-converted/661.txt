You’ll need to get hold of ice lettuce (ficoïde glaciale) and lemon balm or lemon verbena herb for this recipe, but it’s well worth seeking out these unusual ingredients for this lightly spiced fish supper.

Ingredients

½ head iceberg lettuce
icing sugar
1 bunch ice lettuce (known as ficoïde glaciale in France)
1 x 400g/14oz tin coconut milk
1 lemongrass stalk, bruised
1 lemon, zest only
1 red chilli, chopped
2 x 140g/5oz turbot fillets, skinned
200g/7oz English salted butter
1 sprig lemon balm or lemon verbena
6 spears English green asparagus, woody ends removed
ground ginger, to taste
bunch fresh watercress




Method


Break the iceberg lettuce into leaves, cut out the cores and trim into small pieces. Dust the iceberg lettuce with icing sugar and place in the freezer along with the ice lettuce for two hours.


In a pan large enough for the turbot, bring the coconut milk up to a simmer with the lemongrass, lemon zest and chilli. Cook for two minutes.


Place the turbot into the coconut milk and gently cook for around six minutes.


Melt the butter in a pan with the lemon balm or verbena. Add the asparagus and simmer for 4-6 minutes, or until the asparagus is soft and tender.


Once the fish is cooked, remove it from the pan and season with salt and ground ginger, to taste.


Divide the fish among two plates with the asparagus and drizzle on some of the coconut milk. Finish with the frozen lettuce and watercress.
