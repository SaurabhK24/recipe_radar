Ingredients
For the mash

½ swede
100g/3½oz butter
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the lamb

1 lamb steak
2 tsp wholegrain mustard
30g/1oz breadcrumbs
2 tbsp grated parmesan
2 tbsp fresh thyme leaves
oil for frying




Method


For the mash, peel and roughly chop the swede. Boil in water until soft when tested with the point of a knife.


Preheat the grill to a high heat.


Massage the lamb all over with the mustard.


On a plate combine the breadcrumbs, parmesan and thyme. Take the steak and roll in the breadcrumb mix so that it is evenly covered.


Grill the steak for six minutes on each side. Drain the swede, mash with the butter and season. Serve together.
