Ingredients

1 orange, peeled and chopped
6 free-range eggs, beaten
2 tbsp icing sugar
85g/3oz egg noodles, cooked according to packet instructions, drained
25g/1oz butter

To serve

1 orange, peeled and sliced
icing sugar, to dust
1 fresh mint sprig




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


In a bowl, mix together the chopped orange, eggs and icing sugar until well combined, then mix in the noodles.


Melt the butter in a small ovenproof frying pan and pour in the noodle mixture. Fry for 4-5 minutes, or until golden-brown on the bottom, then transfer to the oven to cook through for 6-8 minutes, or until golden-brown all over and set.


Slide the noodle cake out onto a plate and decorate with the orange slices. Dust with icing sugar and top with a sprig of fresh mint. Serve.
