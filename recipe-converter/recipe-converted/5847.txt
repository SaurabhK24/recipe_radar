Ingredients

125g/4½oz wholemeal plain flour
1 free-range egg
300ml/½ pint skimmed milk
1 tsp olive oil
low-calorie cooking spray
mixed berries (strawberries, raspberries, blueberries)
4 tbsp low-fat yoghurt




Method


Place the flour into a bowl. Beat the egg, milk and oil together, then slowly add to the flour. Stir the mixture until a smooth batter forms. Leave to stand for about 20 minutes, then stir again.


Spray a nonstick frying pan with oil. When the oil is hot, add 2 tablespoons of the pancake mixture and shake the pan so that it spreads. Cook the pancake for 2 minutes, or until the underside is lightly browned. Turn over and cook the other side for a further minute.


Keep the pancake warm while you cook the rest. The mixture should make 8 pancakes in all. Divide the pancakes between 4 plates, top the pancakes with the mixed berries and yoghurt and serve.
