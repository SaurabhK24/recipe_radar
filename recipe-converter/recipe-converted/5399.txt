Ingredients

12 tinned apricot halves
250g/9oz ready-made puff pastry
2 tsp apricot jam
4 tsp raspberry jam




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper.


Pat four apricot halves dry with kitchen paper and set aside. Chop the remaining apricots into small pieces.


Sprinkle flour on a work surface and roll the pastry out into a large rectangle. Use a 10cm/4in pastry cutter (or a small bowl) to cut out four circles. Use a 8cm/3in pastry cutter to press down lightly in the middle of each circle, then place on the baking tray.


Brush the apricot jam in the smaller circle of each piece of pastry, then top each with an apricot half. Arrange the chopped apricots around the half, ensuring the pastry border is clear.


Drizzle over the raspberry jam.


Bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes, or until the pastry is risen and golden-brown.
