A lighter take on mince pies but these moreish treats are still packed full of festive cheer.





By Emily Angle






Ingredients

25g/1oz unsalted butter, melted
150g/5½oz mincemeat (use one with lots of fruit)
125g/4½oz ripe or tinned pear, chopped
50g/1¾oz chopped satsumas
2 tsp cornflour
5 sheets filo pastry




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Brush the cups of a 12-cup bun tin with a little melted butter.


Mix the mincemeat with the pear, satsumas and cornflour in a bowl, stirring until the cornflour has dissolved.


Lay a sheet of filo on the work surface and brush with melted butter. Place another sheet of filo on top , and brush again with butter. Place a third sheet of filo on top and brush with butter. Cut the stack of filo into 12 pieces (a pizza wheel is good for this). Press a piece of filo into each cup of the bun tin.


Divide the mincemeat mixture equally between the pastry-lined cups.


Butter the remaining sheets of filo separately, and cut each piece into 6. Scrunch up the pieces and put one on top of each mince pie. The more crinkles, the better.


Bake in the oven for 15 minutes, or until the top is golden-brown and crisp. Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring carefully to a wire rack. These really are best eaten warm from the oven, as they tend to soften when cool. But the pies can also be reheated for 5 minutes to crisp up again.
