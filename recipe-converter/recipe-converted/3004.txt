Ingredients
For the fritters

100g/3½oz plain flour
1 tsp baking powder
pinch smoked paprika
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp caster sugar
2 free-range eggs
75ml/2½fl oz milk
100g/3½oz courgettes, grated
75g/2½oz canned sweetcorn
6 spring onions, finely chopped
2 tbsp vegetable oil

For the salsa

200g/7oz large green olives, stones removed
2 lemons, juice and zest only
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 tbsp capers
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
50ml/2fl oz extra virgin olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp fresh peas (or frozen peas defrosted)




Method


For the fritters, mix the flour, baking powder, paprika, salt and freshly ground black pepper and sugar in a bowl.


In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs and milk together.


Gradually add the egg and milk mixture to the dry ingredients, whisking constantly, to form a smooth batter.


Place the courgettes, sweetcorn and spring onions into a bowl and mix well.


Add some of the batter to the vegetable mixture - just enough to bind the vegetables together.


Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Place a large spoonful of the fritter mixture into the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown all over. Remove and drain on kitchen paper. Set aside in a warm place and repeat the process until all the fritter mixture is used up.


For the salsa, crush the olives gently with a pestle and mortar (or blend with a food processor). Place the olives into a bowl with all of the other salsa ingredients and mix well.


To serve, place two fritters on each plate and serve a dollop of salsa alongside.
