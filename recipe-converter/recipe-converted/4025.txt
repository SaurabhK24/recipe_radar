Ingredients

100g/3½oz butter, plus extra for greasing
100g/3½oz caster sugar
4 ready-made ginger biscuits
120g/4oz pistachio nuts
55g/2oz plain flour
200g/7oz frozen forest fruits

For the custard

5 tbsp milk
5 tbsp double cream
1 free-range egg yolk
1 tbsp caster sugar




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Grease an ovenproof dish with butter.


Place the butter, sugar, ginger biscuits, pistachios and flour into a food processor and pulse until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.


Place a layer of the frozen forest fruits into the base of the ovenproof dish and top with the crumble mixture.


Transfer to the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, until the topping is crisp and golden.


For the custard, place the milk and cream into a saucepan over a medium heat and heat until steaming. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.


Whisk the egg yolk and sugar together in a bowl.


Gradually pour the milk and cream mixture into the yolk and sugar, whisking constantly.


Return the custard mixture to the milk saucepan and simmer gently over a medium heat, stirring constantly, until the custard thickens and coats the back of a spoon.


Strain the custard through a sieve into a jug.


To serve, spoon a portion of the crumble into a bowl and pour over some custard.
