Sausage and onion hash with a couple of eggs cracked over is definitely worth getting out of bed for.






By Nigel Slater


From Nigel Slater's Dish of the Day






Ingredients

2 tbsp groundnut oil
50g/1¾oz butter
3 herby sausages, skinned
1 onion, sliced
½ large potato, including skin
2 free-range eggs




Method


Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the butter and skinned sausages and cook for a few minutes, stirring to ensure all the meat browns.


Add the onion to the pan.


Grate the potato including the skin and squeeze over the sink to remove any moisture.


Add the potato to the pan.


When the pan ingredients are cooked, crack the eggs into the pan. Serve.
