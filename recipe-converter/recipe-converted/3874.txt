Ingredients

4-6 bacon rashers bacon
4 free-range eggs
4 tbsp full-fat probiotic yoghurt (or ready-made apple sauce)
4 tbsp coconut flour
40g/1½oz mature Cheddar, grated
2 spring onions, trimmed, finely sliced
small handful kale, tough stems removed, leaves finely sliced
¼ tsp baking powder
¼ tsp salt
large pinch freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 6. Line 4 of the holes of a large muffin tin with baking paper.


Heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium to high heat. Add the bacon in batches and dry-fry until crisp. Allow to cool, then chop into pieces and set aside.


Beat the eggs and the yoghurt together until smooth and aerated, then stir in the remaining ingredients until well combined.


Divide the muffin batter equally among 4 of the holes of the prepared muffin tin, or until the mixture reaches three-quarters of the way up the sides.


Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until the tops of the muffins are golden-brown and a skewer inserted into the centre of the muffins comes out clean.
