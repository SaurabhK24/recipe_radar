Ingredients

110g/4 oz self-raising flour
water, to mix
1 onion, sliced
hot oil, to deep fry

For the sauce

1 red pepper, de-seeded and chopped
½ tsp chilli flakes
sea salt
50ml/1¾fl oz double cream
½ vegetable stock cube




Method


For the onion rings, mix together the flour and water to make the batter consistency of single cream.


Heat the oil in a deep, heavy-based saucepan. Dip the onion rings into the batter and then drop in batches into the hot oil for 2-3 minutes. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be very dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Remove and drain on kitchen paper.


For the sauce, place all of the ingredients in a saucepan and bring to the boil over a medium heat.


Let simmer for 2-3 minutes. Using a hand blender, blend ingredients until smooth.


Serve with the onion rings.
