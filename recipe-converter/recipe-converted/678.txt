Ingredients
For the turkey dumplings

1 shallot, chopped
4 spring onions, chopped
2 garlic cloves, crushed
½ tsp chopped root ginger
1 red chilli, deseeded and chopped
6 button mushrooms, chopped
350g/12oz minced turkey
2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
1 lemon, finely grated zest only
salt and pepper
2 tbsp vegetable oil

For the cabbage

3 tbsp soy sauce
½ glass dry white wine
150ml/¼ pint chicken stock
2 tsp cornflour
dash vegetable oil
1 red chilli, seeds removed, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
½ small green cabbage, shredded




Method


In a blender combine the shallot, spring onion, garlic, ginger, chilli and mushrooms. Pulse to form a smooth purée, then transfer to a bowl. Add the turkey, Worcestershire sauce and lemon zest, and mix well. Season with salt and pepper.


Heat a little vegetable oil in a large frying pan or wok and cook a small amount of the turkey mixture. Taste to check the seasoning and adjust as necessary.


Roll the remaining mixture into 28 evenly sized balls and fry in more vegetable oil until golden-brown all over. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, then remove from the pan and keep warm.


For the cabbage, mix the soy sauce, white wine, stock and cornflour together until smooth.


Add the chilli and garlic to a pan with a dash of vegetable oil and quickly fry over a high heat. Add the cabbage and cook for two minutes. Add the turkey balls and cook for 30 seconds.


Pour in the cornflour mixture, bring to the boil and cook for two minutes. Serve immediately.
