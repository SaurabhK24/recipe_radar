Ingredients
For the caramelised onions

1 tbsp olive oil
½ red onion, peeled and sliced
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
3 tbsp soft brown sugar
drizzle of honey

For the tofu

1 tbsp olive oil
½ packet organic tofu
1 slice Stinking Bishop cheese

To serve

1 tbsp olive oil
large handful spinach leaves
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the onions, heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan. Add the onion and sauté for 1-2 minutes.


Add the balsamic vinegar, sugar and honey. Reduce the heat to cook to onions gently for 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally until caramelised.


Meanwhile, for the tofu, heat the oil in a pan. Add the tofu and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden.


Lay the cheese slice on top of the tofu and transfer to the grill to cook until the cheese has melted and is golden.


For the spinach, heat the oil in a pan. Add the spinach and salt and freshly ground black pepper, stirring well until wilted down.


To serve, transfer the cooked spinach to the centre of a warm plate. Top with the cheesy tofu and then spoon over the caramelised onions.
