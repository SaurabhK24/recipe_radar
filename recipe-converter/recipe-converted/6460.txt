Ingredients

8 tbsp olive oil
1 onion, chopped
3 mixed peppers, chopped
2 tbsp garlic, crushed
4 links chorizo sausage, chopped
450g/1 lb chicken pieces, on or off the bone
2 Scotch Bonnet or other hot chilli peppers, 1 red, 1 yellow, chopped
500g/1 lb 1oz easy-cook American-style rice
1 tsp chilli powder
2 tbsp turmeric
2 tbsp Cajun spices
2 pints chicken stock or water
mixed vegetables, such as carrots, peas, green beans, sprouts, courgettes, chopped (frozen vegetables will suffice)
450g/1 lb king prawns or crayfish
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Heat the olive oil in a large pan and add the onion, mixed peppers, garlic, chorizo and chicken pieces. Cook for about ten minutes.


Add the chilli peppers. These are very hot so be careful how many you add. When handling them, take care if you have any cuts as they will really hurt.


Add the rice and stir well. Add the chilli powder, turmeric and Cajun spices and mix in so the rice is well coated with the flavours.


Add the chicken stock or water and bring to a simmer.


Add the mixed vegetables and bring to the boil then turn the heat down to a simmer.


Once the rice has swollen and is part-cooked, add the prawns or crayfish.


Simmer for about 45 minutes to an hour. Taste for seasoning and add salt and freshly ground black pepper and more spices, depending on your personal taste.


Serve.
