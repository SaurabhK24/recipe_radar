Ingredients

1 bunch coriander, washed
12 mint leaves, washed
1 tsp salt
3 cloves garlic, crushed
2 green chillies, seeds removed
3 tbsp fresh lime juice
1 tbsp fish sauce (nam pla)
2 tbsp caster sugar
2 tsp peeled and chopped ginger
4 x 175g/6oz salmon fillets
450g/1lb pak choi
1 tbsp sesame oil
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 clove garlic, thinly sliced
85g/3oz spring onions, finely sliced
2 red chillies, de-seeded and finely sliced
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp soy sauce




Method


In a food processor, blend together the coriander leaves and stalks, the mint leaves, salt, garlic and chillies to make a paste.


Add the lime juice, fish sauce, one tablespoon of the caster sugar and one teaspoon of the ginger, and process until smooth. Spoon the sauce into a bowl and combine with the salmon. Marinate for 20 minutes.


Boil water in the bottom half of a steamer. Place the bowl with the marinated salmon in the top half and steam it for 6-8 minutes.


Blanch the pak choi in boiling salted water for two minutes, drain and refresh.


In a wok, heat the sesame oil and vegetable oil. When hot, add the garlic, spring onions, chillies and the remaining ginger. Cook for one minute.


Add the soy sauce, the remaining caster sugar and the pak choi. Toss to warm through. Season to taste.


Place the pak choi in the centre of a serving plate and put the steamed salmon on top. Serve immediately with the salad.
