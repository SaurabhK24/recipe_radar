Ingredients

25g/1oz butter, melted
½ ripe mango, peeled, stone removed, sliced
icing sugar, to dust
115g/4oz express cooked basmati rice
200g/7oz canned coconut milk
2 tbsp double cream
2 tbsp clear honey




Method


Heat a griddle pan until very hot.


Brush the butter all over the mango and then dust lightly with the icing sugar. Place onto the griddle pan and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side, until heated through and lightly charred.


Meanwhile, place the rice, coconut milk and cream into a clean pan over a medium heat.


Stir in the honey and heat gently until warmed through, but not boiling.


To serve, spoon the coconut rice pudding into a warmed wide-rimmed bowl and arrange the griddled mango on top.
