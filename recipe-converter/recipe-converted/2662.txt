A simple, tasty chutney ideal for having with left-over turkey or cold meats during Christmas.



Ingredients

450g/1lb onions, peeled and chopped
5 tbsp water
900g/2lb cooking apples, peeled, cored and chopped
700g/1½ pears, peeled, cored and chopped
85g/3oz dates, stoned and chopped
570ml/1 pint cider vinegar
1 tsp salt
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp cayenne powder
225g/8oz sugar




Method


Put the onions and the water in a large heavy-based pan. Bring to the boil and simmer until soft.


Add the apples and pears and continue cooking gently for 15-20 minutes. Add the dates, salt, spices and half the vinegar. Cook, stirring occasionally until the mixture thickens.


Add the sugar and the rest of the vinegar, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Continue to simmer until the chutney becomes really thick. Stir occasionally.


When ready, pot and seal in sterilised jars and leave to mature for a week or longer.
