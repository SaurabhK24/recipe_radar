Ingredients

250g/9oz udon noodles
1.5 litre/2½ pints dashi or miso stock (from sachet)
50ml/2fl oz mirin
50ml/2fl oz dark soy sauce
100g/3½oz firm tofu, cubed
6 spring onions, sliced
a few strands wakame seaweed
1 pak choi, broken into separate leaves
4 x 200g/7oz salmon fillets, skin on, scaled and pin-boned
1 tbsp sunflower oil
Japanese seven-spice powder (available from specialist suppliers online and Asian stores), to taste

To serve

¼ mouli, peeled and julienned (if you can't get mouli, some shredded cabbage would also work here)
few coriander leaves, to garnish




Method


To cook the noodles, plunge them into a pan of boiling water.


Cook the noddles for four minutes and then drain and refresh in a bowl of iced cold water. Drain again.


Put the dashi stock into a saucepan and add the mirin, soy sauce and tofu. Add the sliced spring onions and wakame seaweed. Simmer for 3-4 minutes. Stir in the pack choi and allow to wilt for 1-2 minutes.


Preheat a griddle pan. Brush the salmon with oil and dust with the Japanese seven-spice powder.


Grill the salmon skin-side down on the griddle pan for 2-3 minutes, before turning over and finishing for a further 1-2 minutes.


To serve warm the udon noodles in the miso broth and ladle into serving bowls. Spoon the hot broth over.


Top with the griddled salmon and garnish with the strips of mouli and coriander leaf to serve.
