Ingredients
For the pear chutney

1 tbsp oil
¼ onion, chopped
½ pear, peeled, core removed, and chopped
1 tbsp white wine vinegar
1 tbsp brown sugar
1 tbsp ketchup

For the sautéed potatoes

200g/7oz new potatoes, sliced
3 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the chilli fried duck

2 tbsp olive oil
½ duck breast, skin removed, sliced into strips
½ red chilli, thinly sliced
1 tbsp honey
2 tbsp soy sauce




Method


For the pear chutney, heat the oil in a saucepan. Add the onion and pear and sauté for 2-3 minutes. Stir in the vinegar, brown sugar and ketchup. Cover with a lid and simmer for ten minutes.


For the sautéed potatoes, bring a small saucepan of water to the boil. Add the sliced potatoes and boil for five minutes until nearly cooked, then drain. Heat the oil in a frying pan and sauté the potatoes over a high heat until golden-brown and tender. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


For the duck, heat the oil in another frying pan. Fry the duck over a high heat for 5-6 minutes until golden brown and cooked through. Add the chilli, honey and soy sauce. Remove from the heat and set aside to rest.


Spoon the potatoes onto a plate and arrange the duck strips on top. Serve with the chutney.
