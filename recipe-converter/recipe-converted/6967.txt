Ingredients

350g/12oz white bread flour
150g/5½oz rye flour
7g dry instant yeast (1 sachet)
1 tsp sugar
1 tsp salt
1 tbsp oil or butter
300ml/10 fl oz milk, warmed

For the topping

2 garlic cloves, crushed
25g/1oz butter or oil
salt




Method


If using a stand mixer, attach the dough hook. Put all the dry ingredients in, mixing in the yeast thoroughly before you add the salt, then add the butter. Start the motor running and gradually add all the milk until you have a dough. If your dough is still a little dry add a little water. Knead with the dough hook for 5 minutes. Cover with a damp cloth and leave somewhere warm to rise until doubled in size, this will take at least an hour.


If you are doing this by hand, put the dry ingredients in a large bowl and mix. Add the butter and combine. Make a well in the centre and gradually incorporate all of the milk, taking flour from the sides as you go. When you have something resembling a dough, knead until smooth. Leave to rise as before.


When your bread has risen, knock back the dough, and cut it into 8 pieces. Knead each piece and form it into a tight ball (by tucking the dough under as you turn it). Dust a baking tray with a little flour and arrange the dough balls on the tray – one in the middle, the others placed around it, placed slightly apart – like a flower. Cover the bread rolls with a damp cloth and leave to rise again.


Preheat the oven to its highest setting.


When the bread rolls are well risen and are just touching, they are ready to bake. Put in the oven and immediately reduce the temperature to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Bake for around 20 minutes.


Meanwhile, make the topping. Mash the garlic, butter and salt together. Put in a frying pan and melt very gently – you don’t want either the butter or the garlic to brown. When the bread rolls are out of the oven, spread the mixture over the rolls while they are still hot.
