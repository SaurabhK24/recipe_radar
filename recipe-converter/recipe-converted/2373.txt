Utterly scrumptious, these are a kid's dream pancake loaded with chocolate chips and served with ice cream.






By Silvana Franco


From Saturday Kitchen






Ingredients

2 eggs
5 tbsp milk
150g/5oz plain flour
2 tbsp caster sugar
pinch of salt
75g/3oz dark chocolate chips
sunflower oil, for frying
butterscotch ice cream, to serve
maple syrup or clear honey, to serve




Method


Whisk together the eggs and milk.


Place the plain flour, caster sugar and a pinch of salt in large bowl, then make a well in the centre, pour in the liquid and beat with a hand whisk until smooth.


Stir in the chocolate chips, then cook spoonfuls of the mixture in a non-stick pan, using just a tiny splash of sunflower oil, for 1-2 minutes on each side until puffed and golden.


Stack and serve with a scoop of butterscotch ice cream and a drizzle of maple syrup.
