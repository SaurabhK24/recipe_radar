Ingredients

150g/5½oz plain flour, plus extra for flouring
1 lemon, zest only
1 orange, zest only
50g/1½oz caster sugar
50g/1½oz fresh cranberries
2 free-range eggs




Method


Preheat a baking sheet in the oven at 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Place all the ingredients into the bowl of a food processor and blend until the ingredients have combined and formed a dough.


Place the dough onto a floured surface and shape the dough, with floured hands, into a long ciabatta shape.


Place the ciabatta onto the hot baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes, or until cooked through and golden-brown in colour. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for two minutes.


Cut diagonally into thin slices to make the biscotti.


To serve, place the biscotti into a clean bowl.
