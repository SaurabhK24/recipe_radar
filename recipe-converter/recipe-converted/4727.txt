Ingredients

2 ready-made flour tortillas, sliced into strips
2 tsp olive oil
½ avocado, peeled, stone removed
1 chilli, halved, seeds removed
1 lime, juice only
2 tbsp Greek yoghurt
sprig fresh parsley, to garnish




Method


Heat a griddle pan until smoking. Drizzle the tortilla strips with olive oil and place into the griddle pan. Cook for 1-2 minutes on each side, until crisp.


Place all of the remaining ingredients, except the parsley sprig, into a food processor and blend until smooth.


To serve, place the guacamole into a serving bowl and garnish with the parsley. Place the crisp tortilla strips on a plate alongside.
