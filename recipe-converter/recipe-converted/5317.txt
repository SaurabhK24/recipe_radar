Ingredients
For the meatballs

¼ onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
250g/9oz minced beef
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tsp chopped fresh rosemary
1 tbsp olive oil

For the sauce

dash olive oil
¼ onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, chopped
85g/3oz chestnut mushrooms, sliced
100ml/3½fl oz red wine
1 tbsp tomato purée
100ml/3½fl oz hot beef stock

For the cheesy mash

1 small potato, peeled and chopped, then boiled until tender and drained
30g/1oz butter
50g/2oz Port Salut cheese, chopped
splash milk
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the meatballs, place the onion, garlic, mince, seasoning and chopped rosemary into a large bowl and mix well. Using your hands, shape the mixture into golfball-sized balls.


Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and fry the meatballs for 6-8 minutes, stirring frequently, or until golden-brown on all sides.


For the sauce, add a little more oil to the pan with the meatballs and sauté the onion for 3-4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for one minute. Add the mushrooms and sauté for 2-3 minutes.


Add the red wine, turn up the heat and simmer for 1-2 minutes. Add the tomato purée and beef stock and simmer for 8-10 minutes, or until the sauce is thickened and the meatballs are completely cooked through.


For the mash, place the cooked potatoes into a large bowl. Add the butter, cheese, milk and seasoning and mash together with a potato masher until smooth.


To serve, place the mash onto a serving plate and spoon over the meatballs and sauce.
