Ingredients

2 tbsp olive oil
4 shallots, finely sliced
1 red onion, finely sliced
salt and freshly ground black pepper
25g/1oz butter
150g/5½oz wild mushrooms, halved
1 smoked garlic clove, finely chopped
125g/4½oz couscous
chopped fresh parsley, to garnish




Method


Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the shallots and onions and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook over a gentle heat for eight minutes, stirring frequently, until soft and lightly caramelised.


In a separate pan, heat the butter, add the mushrooms and garlic and cook over a medium heat for 2-3 minutes.


Place the couscous in a bowl and pour over enough boiling water to cover the couscous by a centimetre. Cover with cling film and leave until all the water has been absorbed.


Remove the cling film and fluff up the grains with a fork and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, pile the couscous onto a serving plate and top with the caramelised onions and mushrooms. Garnish with parsley.
