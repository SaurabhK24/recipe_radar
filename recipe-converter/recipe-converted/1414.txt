Ingredients
For the buffalo wings

900g/2lb chicken wings
50g/2oz butter, melted
100g/3½ hot pepper sauce
1 tbsp smoked paprika
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the slaw

1 celeriac, peeled and coarsely grated
3 apples, peeled and coarsely grated
½ red onion, finely sliced
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
100g/3½oz mayonnaise
1 tbsp white wine vinegar




Method


For the marinade, mix all the ingredients in a bowl until well combined. Add the chicken wings, ensuring they are well coated in the marinade. Cover with clingfilm and chill in a fridge overnight.


Preheat the grill to medium.


Remove the wings from the fridge and place them onto a grill pan. Grill for 6-7 minutes on each side, basting with the marinade and juices as they cook.


Meanwhile, for the slaw, combine all the ingredients in a bowl and mix until well combined.


Once the chicken wings are cooked, serve straight away with the slaw and plenty of napkins.
