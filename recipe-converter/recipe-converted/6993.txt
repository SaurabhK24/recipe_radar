Ingredients

170g/6oz self-raising flour
1 tbsp baking powder
115g/4oz caster sugar
2 eggs
275ml/10fl oz milk
230g/8oz smoked streaky bacon
maple syrup
butter for frying




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Sift the flour, baking powder and caster sugar into a bowl.


Using a whisk, add the eggs and the milk. Be careful not to overwhisk. Put to one side.


Put the bacon on an oven tray and bake until crisp.


Remove and brush over a little of the maple syrup.


To cook the pancakes, preheat a non-stick frying pan. Add a little butter and pour around three spoonfuls of the mixture into the pan - the pancakes should be quite small. Cook until golden brown and turn over to colour the other side. Remove and place on a large plate.


To serve, pile the pancakes on the plate and arrange the bacon around and on top. Drizzle with maple syrup and serve.
