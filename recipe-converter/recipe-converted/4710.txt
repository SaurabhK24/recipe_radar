Ingredients
For the prawns

3 tbsp olive oil
1 lemon, juice only
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
2 tbsp chopped fresh basil
2 tbsp chopped fresh chives
3 tiger prawns, peeled and de-veined, heads and tails left on

For the spinach salad

1 handful baby spinach

For the red pepper dressing

1 red pepper
3 tbsp olive oil
1 lemon, juice only
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Soak a wooden skewer in cold water for ten minutes.


For the prawns, mix the olive oil, lemon juice and herbs together in a bowl and add the prawns. Toss to coat, then leave to marinate for 5-10 minutes.


Thread the prawns onto the skewer and cook on a hot chargrill pan for 1-2 minutes on both sides, or until the prawns are pink and cooked through.


For the salad, place the spinach in the centre of a serving plate.


For the red pepper dressing, place the red pepper under a grill unit's highest setting. Turn occasionally, until blackened all over. Allow to cool before peeling off the skin, then chop the flesh and place into a food processor along with the remaining dressing ingredients. Blend until smooth.


To serve, place the prawn skewer on top of the spinach and spoon the dressing around the edges of the plate.
