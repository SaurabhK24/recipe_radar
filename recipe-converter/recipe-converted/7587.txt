Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
¼ onion, sliced
150g/5½oz fresh peas
100ml/3½fl oz water
½ chicken or vegetable stock cube
100ml/3½oz double cream
55g/2oz butter, softened
55g/2oz plain flour
1 carrot, peeled and grated
1 tbsp chopped fresh tarragon
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Heat the olive oil in a saucepan. Add the onion and sweat for five minutes.


Add the peas, water, stock cube and double cream, then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 3-4 minutes or until the peas are cooked.


In a small bowl, mix the butter and flour together to make a paste. Slowly add the paste to the peas a little at a time, whisking it in, until the liquid becomes thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.


Add the grated carrot and the tarragon, and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Serve in two soup bowls.
