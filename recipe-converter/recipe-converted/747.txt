Ingredients
For the soaked bread mixture

2 free-range egg yolks
75ml/2½fl oz coconut milk
75ml/2½fl oz double cream
½ lime, zest and juice
2 tbsp soft brown sugar
1 tsp vanilla essence
2 slices white bread, crusts cut off, cut into pieces

For the mango topping

55g/2oz butter
2 tbsp soft brown sugar
½ lime, juice only
½ mango, stone removed, peeled, sliced




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the soaked bread mixture, in a bowl, whisk together all ingredients, except the bread. Soak the chunks of bread in the mixture for five minutes.


For the mango topping, melt the butter and sugar together in a small ovenproof, non-reactive frying pan. Add the lime juice and mango and fry until the sugar has dissolved and is starting to bubble.


Pour the bread and egg mixture over the mango mixture and bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until the soaked bread mixture is golden-brown and has set.


To serve, invert the pudding onto a plate.
