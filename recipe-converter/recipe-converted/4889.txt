Ingredients
For the herb-crusted red snapper

1 red snapper fillet, skinned
55g/2oz cashew nuts
small handful fresh flatleaf parsley
small piece fresh coconut, flesh only
1 tbsp vegetable oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp Dijon mustard

For the ackee

1 tbsp vegetable oil
¼ onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, chopped
150g/5½oz canned ackee, drained
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the tomato and okra chutney

1 tsp vegetable oil
55g/2oz okra, sliced lengthways
1 tbsp tomato purée
2 tbsp white wine
2 tbsp white wine vinegar




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the herb-crusted red snapper, place the snapper fillet onto a non-stick baking sheet.


Place the cashews, parsley, coconut and vegetable oil in a food processor and pulse to combine. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Spread the mustard over the fish and press the crust mixture on top.


Transfer to the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the crust is golden-brown and the fish is cooked through.


For the pan-fried ackee, heat the vegetable oil in a pan over a medium heat, add the onion and fry until soft. Add the garlic and ackee and fry until crisp. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


For the chutney, heat the oil in a pan over a medium heat, add the okra, tomato purée, wine and vinegar and simmer until the liquid is reduced by half and the the okra is tender.


To serve, spoon the chutney into the centre of a plate and top with the fried ackee and the red snapper.
