Ingredients

2 large St Georges mushrooms (weighing approximately150g/5oz) If unavailable use Portobello mushrooms.
20 fresh mint leaves, very finely sliced

For the dressing

1 tsp truffle oil
1 tbsp wholegrain mustard
1 tsp sugar
75ml/2½fl oz white wine vinegar
150ml/5fl oz extra virgin olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
½ lemon, juice only
1 garlic clove, finely chopped

To serve

4 tbsp crème fraîche
pecorino, shaved or grated
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Remove the stalks from the mushrooms and discard. Place the mushroom caps into the freezer for 10-15mins (this will make them easier to slice thinly).


Once the mushrooms are chilled, slice them very thinly (a mandoline is ideal for this, but a sharp knife and a steady hand will do) and arrange the slices onto plates.


Sprinkle with the mint.


For the dressing, place all of the dressing ingredients into a food processor and blend to combine.


To serve, drizzle the mushroom slices with the dressing, then add a spoonful of crème fraîche to each plate.


Sprinkle with freshly grated or shaved pecorino cheese and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
