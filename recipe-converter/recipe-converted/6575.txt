Carluccio’s tasty wild mushrooms encased in filo pastry make a stunning vegetarian centerpiece.






By Antonio Carluccio


From Great British Food Revival






Ingredients

4 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for the pastry
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1.2kg/2lb 7oz wild mushrooms, larger mushrooms chopped
3 tbsp coarsely chopped parsley
1 small chilli, finely chopped (optional)
8 rectangles ready-made filo pastry, about 20x20cm/8x8in
small bunch fresh chives




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/450F/Gas 8.


Heat the oil in a frying pan, add the garlic and mushrooms and fry over a high heat for 3-4 minutes, or until just cooked. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and sprinkle over the parsley. Set aside to cool.


Brush one side of each sheet of filo pastry all over with a little olive oil.


Place one sheet of filo pastry on top of another to create two layers of pastry, then spoon a quarter of the mushroom mixture into the centre of the pastry.


Gather up the corners of the pastry to create a parcel and secure with a couple of chives. Brush all over with olive oil and place onto a baking tray.


Repeat the process with the remaining filo pastry and mushroom mixture.


Bake the parcels for 10-12 minutes, or until the pastry is cooked through and golden-brown.
