A great summer dish for light, fresh eating. Vary the herbs in the green sauce according to what you can get hold of.

Ingredients
For the wild salmon

2 tbsp olive oil
4 x 150-200g/5Â½-7oz pieces wild salmon fillet

For the sauce vierge

120ml/4fl oz extra virgin olive oil
1 lemon, juice only
2 tomatoes, skin and seeds removed, diced
1 shallot, finely diced
1 garlic clove finely chopped
2 tbsp baby capers
2 tbsp torn fresh basil
2 tbsp chopped fresh chervil
2 tbsp chopped fresh dill
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
2 tbsp snipped fresh chives
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the wild salmon, heat a large frying pan and, once hot, add the oil. Place the fillets of salmon skin-side down for three minutes and turn over for another three minutes. Remove from the pan and leave to rest in a warm place.


For the sauce vierge, pour the olive oil into a non-reactive pan. Whisk in the lemon juice until well combined. Add the chopped tomatoes, shallot, garlic and capers.


Heat the pan over a medium heat until the mixture is just warmed through.


Add the basil, chervil, dill, parsley and chives and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, divide the salmon among four plates and then spoon the sauce vierge over the top.
