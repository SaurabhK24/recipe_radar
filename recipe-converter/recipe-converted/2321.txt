Ingredients
For the chilli and black pepper chicken

100g/3½oz fresh breadcrumbs
2 tsp salt
2 tsp dried chilli flakes
1 chicken breast, flattened out with a meat malletand cut into 2 equal pieces
1 tbsp plain flour
1 free-range egg, beaten
1 tbsp butter, melted

For the polenta fritters

250g/9oz instant polenta
300ml/½pint boiling water, with a pinch of salt added
1 tbsp butter

For the griddled squash

1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing
½ butternut squash, par-boiled for 5 minutes and drained, cut into pieces
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the chilli and black pepper chicken, mix the breadcrumbs, salt and chilli flakes in a bowl.


Dip the chicken in plain flour, shake off excess, then dip in beaten egg, then dip in breadcrumb mix. Bash gently with a knife to make the breadcrumbs stick.


Heat the butter in a frying pan and then fry the chicken for five minutes on each side or until golden brown and cooked through. Keep warm.


To make the polenta fritters, put the polenta into a pan with the boiling salted water, and cook, stirring frequently, over a low heat until all the water has been absorbed.


Oil a baking tray and pour the polenta into the tray. Refrigerate until set.


Use a 6cm circular cutter to cut two circles out of the polenta. Heat the butter in a frying pan and fry for two minutes on each side.


To make the griddled butternut squash, brush the pieces with olive oil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a griddle pan until smoking hot and cook for 3 minutes on each side, until tender.


To serve, place the polenta fritters on a large plate, put the chicken on top and serve with the griddled butternut squash on the side.
