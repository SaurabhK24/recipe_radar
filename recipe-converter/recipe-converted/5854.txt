Ingredients
For the fish fingers

1 free-range egg
75g/2½oz white breadcrumbs
pinch paprika
250g/9oz firm white fish, such as hake or cod, cut into bite-sized strips
1 tbsp vegetable oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

To serve

2 tbsp mayonnaise
½ tsp curry powder
squeeze of lemon juice
4 wholemeal pitta breads
1 Cos lettuce or baby gem, leaves torn into pieces




Method


In a shallow bowl whisk the egg. In another bowl combine the breadcrumbs and paprika, season with salt and pepper.


Dip the fish fingers into the egg, making sure they are completely coated and shaking off any excess. Then carefully dip the fish fingers in the breadcrumb mixture to coat them all over.


Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. Fry the fish fingers for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden-brown and cooked through. Remove from the pan and drain on kitchen paper.


While the fish is cooking combine the mayonnaise, curry powder and lemon juice in a small bowl and set aside.


Serve the fish fingers in wholemeal pittas with the mayonnaise and lettuce.
