50g/2oz cambozola cheese
2 slices Parma ham

For the sweet potato mash

½ sweet potato, peeled and cubed
300ml/10fl oz boiling water
25g/1oz butter

Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/390F/Gas 6.


For the stuffed chicken, place the chicken on a board and flatten out. Place the cheese in the centre of the chicken and wrap the chicken around it. Wrap the Parma ham wrap around the chicken to make a parcel.


Heat a non-stick pan and fry the chicken until golden. Place into the preheated oven and cook for 12 minutes.


For the sweet potato mash, boil the sweet potato in the water for 8 minutes, or until tender. Drain and mash then add the butter, cream, seasoning and chopped parsley.


For the stir fried broccoli, heat a wok and add the oil. Add the onions and cook for four minutes.


Add the broccoli and chilli and cook for a further five minutes.


To serve, place the mash on the middle of the plate and top with the chicken. Serve the broccoli on the side.
