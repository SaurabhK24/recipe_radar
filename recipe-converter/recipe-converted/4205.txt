Ingredients

1 free-range egg
50ml/2fl oz vegetable oil
30ml/1¼fl oz orange juice
100g/3½oz cooked beetroot, patted dry with kitchen paper, grated
100g/3½oz wholemeal flour
1 tsp baking powder
3 tbsp caster sugar
50g/2oz sunflower seeds
1 tsp mixed spice




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Line a 6-hole muffin tray with paper cases.


In a large mixing bowl, beat together the egg, oil and orange juice until well combined. Stir in the grated beetroot.


In a separate mixing bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, sugar, sunflower seeds and mixed spice until well combined.


Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients one tablespoon at a time, mixing well after each addition.


Divide the muffin mixture equally among the six muffin cases. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the muffins are cooked through (a skewer inserted into the centre should come out clean). Set aside to cool, then serve.




Recipe Tips
You can make smaller muffins using a mini-muffin tin, but remember to adjust the cooking time as they will cook more quickly.
