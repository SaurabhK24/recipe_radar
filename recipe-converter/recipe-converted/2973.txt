Inspired by the Yorkshire pudding, but filled with luscious shallots and sweet golden carrots. This stunning twist on a classic is named in honour of Nigel and Adam’s farm in the Cotswolds.

Ingredients
For the batter

180ml/6fl oz milk
180g/6oz plain flour
2 free-range eggs

For the vegetables

3 tbsp beef dripping (but any oil will do if you want it to be vegetarian)
4 large banana shallots, sliced in half lengthways
4 carrots, roughly chopped
6 garlic cloves, peeled but left whole
6 sprigs thyme, leaves only
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the batter, whisk together the milk, flour, eggs and 120ml/4½fl oz water in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes.


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Heat the beef dripping in a large pan over a moderate heat.


Sit the shallots in the pan cut-side down, and cook until softened.


Add the carrots and garlic and cook until they have browned and caramelised - about five minutes.


Transfer the pan ingredients to an oven dish, add the thyme, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and place in the oven to get piping hot for five minutes.


Once the dripping is sizzling hot, open the oven door and tip the batter over the vegetables as quickly as possible, so not to lose too much heat.


Bake for 20-30 minutes, or until the pudding is well risen and golden-brown .


Serve quickly as otherwise the pudding will deflate.
