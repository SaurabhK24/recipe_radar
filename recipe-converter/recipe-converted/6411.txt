Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
½ onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 tomato, seeds removed, chopped
4 tbsp tomato ketchup
3 mini pitta breads, split in half horizontally
½ yellow pepper, seeds removed, cut into strips
½ red pepper, seeds removed, cut into strips
55g/2oz Manchego cheese, sliced
1 handful iceberg lettuce, shredded, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Heat the olive oil in a pan and fry the onion and garlic for 2-3 minutes, or until softened. Stir in the tomato and ketchup and simmer for 3-4 minutes, or until reduced slightly.


Spread the tomato mixture onto one side of the pitta halves, arrange the pepper strips on top and lay over the cheese. Transfer to a baking sheet and bake in the oven for 3-4 minutes, or until the cheese starts to melt.


Serve the pitta bread pizzas on a serving plate alongside the shredded iceberg lettuce.
