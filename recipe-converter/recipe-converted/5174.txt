Ingredients

450g/1lb large tomatoes (ripe but firm)
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 shallot, finely diced
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 tsp fresh thyme leaves
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
4 canned anchovy fillets, finely chopped
2 tbsp roughly chopped fresh flatleaf parsley
½ tsp dried chilli flakes
50g/1¾oz fresh white breadcrumbs
extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar, to garnish




Method


Cut the tomatoes in half horizontally and carefully remove the seeds. Sprinkle the cut sides with salt and place cut-side down on kitchen paper to remove some liquid. Leave to stand for 20 minutes. Rinse and pat dry with kitchen paper.


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Place the shallot in a food processor with the garlic, thyme leaves, oil and anchovies and then blend to a smooth paste. Transfer to a bowl and fold in the parsley, chilli flakes and breadcrumbs until well combined. Season to taste.


Spoon the bread mixture into the tomato cavities and bake for about 15 minutes until bubbling and golden. Transfer to a dish and serve hot or at room temperature, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
