Ingredients

140g/5oz double cream
few drops of vanilla essence
2 tbsp caster sugar
110g/4oz cream cheese
55g/2oz cinder toffee (also called honeycomb), broken into pieces




Method


Whip the cream with the vanilla essence and sugar in a large bowl, to thicken.


Fold in the cream cheese to combine, and then stir in the cinder toffee.


Spoon the mixture into a chefs ring, lined on a serving plate and smooth off the top using a palette knife.


Transfer to the fridge, and allow to set.


Once chilled, remove from the fridge and remove the ring. Serve.
