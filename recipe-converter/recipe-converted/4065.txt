Ingredients

1 thick slice crusty white bread
1 free-range egg, beaten
25g/1oz butter
2 tbsp icing sugar
1 orange, peeled and sliced
honey, for drizzling
fresh mint leaves, to garnish
double cream, lightly whipped, to serve




Method


Dip the bread into the beaten egg, coating well all over. Melt the butter in a frying pan, add the eggy bread and fry for 1-2 minutes on both sides, or until lightly golden all over.


Sprinkle half the icing sugar over one side and flip over to fry for 1-2 more minutes, or until golden-brown. Sprinkle over the rest of the icing sugar and flip the toast over again and fry for 1-2 minutes, or until the toast is golden-brown all over.


Pile the French toast onto a serving plate, top with the orange slices, drizzle over the honey and garnish with the mint leaves. Serve with a large dollop of double cream on the side.
