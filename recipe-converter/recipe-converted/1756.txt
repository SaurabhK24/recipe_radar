Ingredients
For the squid

4 x squid (about 250g/9oz each), cleaned and cut into triangles
salt and freshly ground black pepper
extra virgin olive oil
1 lime, juice only

For the creamy ponzu dressing

2 free-range eggs, yolks only
½ tsp sea salt
pinch white pepper
2 tsp rice wine vinegar
4 tsp chilli garlic sauce
2 tsp yuzu juice
200ml/7floz vegetable oil

To serve

3 tbsp coriander cress
2 tbsp celery cress
2 tbsp mint leaves, picked
1 handful watercress, leaves picked




Method


For the squid, heat a griddle pan until searing hot.


Season the squid with salt and black pepper and a drizzle of oil.


Place onto the griddle and cook on each side for 30 seconds until charred and just cooked through.


Remove and squeeze the lime over the top.


For the creamy ponzu dressing, place all the ingredients, except the vegetable oil into a small food processor and blend to a purée.


Gradually add in the vegetable oil until a thin mayonnaise forms.


Check the seasoning and add more yuzu juice if desired.


To serve, scatter the cress and leaves over each plate, then place a squid on top and drizzle with the creamy ponzu dressing.
