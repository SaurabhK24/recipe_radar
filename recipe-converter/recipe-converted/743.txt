Ingredients

175g/6oz caster sugar
2 apricots, halved, stones removed
2 tbsp pine nuts
115g/4oz self-raising flour
115g/4oz butter
2 free-range eggs
1 tbsp double cream, plus extra to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Heat 60g/2½oz of the caster sugar in a small ovenproof frying pan until the sugar has melted and turned a caramel colour.


Add the apricots cut-side down and cook for 2-3 minutes. Turn the apricots over and sprinkle over the pine nuts.


Place the flour, the remaining sugar and the butter into a food processor and pulse until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.


Crack in the eggs and add the cream and blend to make a smooth batter. Pour the batter on top of the caramelised apricots and smooth the top.


Transfer to the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden-brown.


To serve, turn the pudding out onto a plate and drizzle with cream.
