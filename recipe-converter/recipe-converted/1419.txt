Ingredients

5 tbsp tahini
2 tsp finely grated ginger
2 tsp honey
½ tsp freshly ground black pepper
pinch salt
2 apples, peeled, cored, sliced into rounds




Method


Mix all of the ingredients except the apple slices together in a small bowl until well combined.


Spread the mixture over the apple slices and serve.




Recipe Tips
When you mix the tahini spread it becomes quite thick, perfect for a transportable snack.

  If you want to serve this as a starter do not mix the tahini spread as it will look prettier and you can use it as a dip. If you are prepping the apples in advance squeeze lemon juice over them so they don't go brown.
