Ingredients
For the onion bhajis

½ onion, peeled, sliced
1 tsp black onion seeds
½ tsp turmeric
2 tbsp chapatti flour
vegetable oil, for deep frying

For the mango salsa

½ small mango, peeled, stone removed, chopped
1 ripe tomato, chopped
1 tsp caster sugar
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander leaves
½ lime, juice only
½ small onion, peeled, finely chopped




Method


For the onion bhajis, combine all the onion bhaji ingredients, except the vegetable oil, in a mixing bowl.


Heat the vegetable oil in a deep heavy-based pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Deep fry tablespoonfuls of the onion mixture until golden-brown, then remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper.


For the salsa, combine all the salsa ingredients in a bowl.


To serve, put the bhajis onto a plate and serve with the salsa.
