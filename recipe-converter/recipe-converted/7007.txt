Ingredients
For the bean and tomato tortilla wraps

200g/7oz tinned kidney beans, rinsed and drained
200g/7oz tinned plum tomatoes, drained
2 tbsp tomato ketchup
1 spring onion, finely chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 ready-made tortilla wraps
handful fresh coriander, roughly chopped
few drops Tabasco sauce
½ avocado, peeled, sliced

For the guacamole

6 tbsp Greek yoghurt
1 garlic clove, crushed
2 tbsp tinned kidney beans, rinsed and drained
½ avocado, peeled
½ lemon, juice only
pinch chilli powder
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the tortilla wraps, place the kidney beans, tomatoes, ketchup and spring onion into a small saucepan and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 3-4 minutes. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Place the tortillas onto two plates and divide the bean mixture between the two. Sprinkle over the coriander and a few drops of Tabasco sauce. Add the sliced avocado and roll the wraps up like a cigar.


Heat a griddle pan and griddle the wraps, turning carefully, until warmed through.


For the guacamole, place all the guacamole ingredients into a bowl, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and roughly mash together with a fork until combined.


To serve, place the wraps onto plates with a dollop of guacamole.
