Ingredients

400g/14oz minced lamb
1 onion, finely grated
3 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste
50g/2oz dried sour cherries, chopped
100g/3½oz pine nuts, lightly toasted and roughly chopped
½ tsp Hungarian paprika
¼ tsp ground allspice
½ tsp ground cumin
1 free-range egg white, lightly whisked
small bunch fresh parsley, finely chopped
small bunch fresh mint, finely chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp vegetable oil




Method


In a large bowl, mix together the minced lamb, onion, garlic, sour cherries, pine nuts, paprika, allspice and cumin. Add the egg white and mix again. Stir in the chopped fresh herbs and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Using your hands, shape the mixture into golf ball-sized balls.


Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the meatballs over a medium heat a few at a time, turning occasionally, for ten minutes, or until golden-brown on all sides and completely cooked through.


Serve the meatballs hot or at room temperature.
