Ingredients
For the crêpe

100g/3½oz plain flour
2 free-range eggs
3 tbsp vegetable oil
3 tbsp caster sugar
100ml/3½fl oz milk
1 banana, peeled and finely sliced

For the chocolate sauce

50g/2oz chocolate broken into pieces
2 tbsp boiling water
handful pecans
1 tbsp double cream, to serve




Method


For the crêpe, place the flour, eggs, two tablespoons of the vegetable oil and caster sugar together into a bowl and whisk together to make a thick paste.


Gradually whisk in the milk, until a smooth batter forms.


Heat the remaining one tablespoon of oil in a shallow frying pan. Place the slices of banana onto the base of the pan, then pour over enough batter to cover in a thin layer. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until golden-brown on base, then carefully turn over and cook for a further minute, until golden-brown on the other side.


For the chocolate sauce, place chocolate pieces in a bowl. Add the boiling water and whisk until the chocolate has melted.


Add the pecans and stir well.


To serve, place the crepe onto a plate and pour chocolate pecan sauce over. Drizzle with double cream and serve.
