A generous glug of maple syrup makes all the difference in Nigella Lawson’s easy roast parsnips recipe.






By Nigella Lawson


From Nigella's Christmas Kitchen






Ingredients

1kg/2¼lb parsnips
125ml/4fl oz vegetable oil
80ml/3½fl oz maple syrup




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Peel the parsnips and then halve them crosswise, then halve or quarter each piece lengthwise.


Place the parsnips into a roasting tin. Pour the oil over the parsnips and mix them well so that the oil covers all of the pieces.


Pour the maple syrup over the parsnips and transfer the roasting tin to the oven. Roast the parsnips for 35 minutes, or until they are tender and golden-brown.
