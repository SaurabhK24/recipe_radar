Ingredients
For the asparagus

6 spears asparagus, trimmed and thick end peeled
2 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the hollandaise

2 free-range egg yolks
1 tsp Dijon mustard
½ lemon, juice only
55g/2oz butter, melted

To serve

1 egg, fried or poached to your liking
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives




Method


For the asparagus, drizzle the asparagus with the olive oil and heat a griddle pan until very hot. Place the asparagus into the griddle pan and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook, turning frequently for 5-6 minutes, until tender and striped with griddle marks.


For the hollandaise, blend the egg yolks, mustard and lemon juice together in a jug with a hand-held blender. With the blender still running, gradually pour in the melted butter, until the hollandaise reaches the consistency of a loose mayonnaise.


Serve the asparagus lined up on a plate with the fried or poached egg placed on top. Spoon the hollandaise around the side and garnish with chopped chives.
