Start the day right with vibrant green veg and an oozing poached egg.





By Rebecca Sargent






Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
1 large handful spinach
1 whole nutmeg, for grating
1 free-range egg
white wine vinegar
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 slice sourdough, toasted




Method


Heat the oil in a pan over a medium heat, add the spinach, a small grating of nutmeg and season with salt and pepper. Pop the lid on and cook on low for 1-2 minutes, until just wilted.


Meanwhile, bring a pan of water to a boil and reduce the heat to a simmer. Add a splash of white wine vinegar and gently break the egg in as close to the surface as possible. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until the egg is cooked to your liking.


To serve, place the spinach on the toast, top with the egg and season with salt and pepper.
