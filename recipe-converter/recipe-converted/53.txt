2 tbsp icing sugar

For the apple jam

2 tbsp butter
2 apples, core removed, sliced
3 tbsp caster sugar
1 vanilla pod, split

Method


For the sweet crostini, heat the butter in a frying pan, add the bread and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side. Dust with icing sugar and fry for a further minute on each side.


For the apple jam, place the butter, apples, caster sugar and vanilla pod into a small saucepan and cook over a low heat for ten minutes, or until the apples have softened and turned jammy.


To serve, spoon the apple jam onto the sweet crostini and serve with whipped double cream.
