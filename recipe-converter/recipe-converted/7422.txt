By Sophie Dahl


From The Delicious Miss Dahl






Ingredients

125g/4½oz butter
500g/1lb 2oz dark brown sugar
120ml/4fl oz milk
250g/9oz crunchy peanut butter
1 vanilla pod, seeds only
300g/10½oz icing sugar




Method


Melt the butter in a saucepan over a medium heat.


Stir in the brown sugar and milk, and bring to the boil for 2-3 minutes, without stirring.


Remove from the heat, and stir in the peanut butter and vanilla seeds.


Place the icing sugar in a large bowl, and pour the hot butter and sugar mixture on top. Using a wooden spoon, beat the mixture until smooth.


Pour into a 20cm/8in square baking tray, and set aside to cool slightly, then place in the fridge to chill completely.


Cut the fudge into squares with a sharp knife, turn out of the tin and store in an airtight container.
