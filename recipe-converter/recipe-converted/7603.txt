Ingredients

1 potato, peeled and cut into cubes
1 tbsp olive oil
55g/2oz butter
1 boneless, skinless pheasant breast, cut into five even-sized pieces
salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 tbsp brandy
4 tbsp double cream
2 tsp chopped fresh chives




Method


To make the mashed potato, place the potato into a pan of boiling salted water and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until tender.


Meanwhile, heat a heavy-bottomed frying pan over a medium heat and add the oil and a knob of the butter. Season the pheasant with salt and freshly ground black pepper and add to the pan. Sauté the pheasant for 2-3 minutes until lightly golden on all sides.


Carefully add the brandy to the pan to flambé the pheasant. Add the cream, stir and heat through. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir in the chives.


For the mashed potato, drain the cooked potato thoroughly, return to the pan and mash to a smooth purée. Beat in the remaining butter and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Spoon the mashed potato on to a warm serving plate and place the pheasant on top. Drizzle the sauce around the pheasant and serve at once.
