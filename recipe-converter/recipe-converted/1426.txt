Ingredients

3 medium aubergines
4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
½ lemon, juice only
10g/¼oz salt
8g ground black pepper
pinch sugar
80g/3oz drained cooked or tinned chickpeas
10 dates, chopped
1 red pepper, finely chopped
small bunch mint, leaves picked and chopped
small bunch coriander, leaves picked and chopped
chilli, to taste, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
40g/1½oz feta, crumbled
handful flaked almonds
balsamic vinegar, for drizzling
croûtons, to serve




Method


Prick the aubergines to allow moisture to escape while cooking.


On a hot barbecue, cook the whole aubergines for 15 minutes, turning every five minutes until the aubergines are soft and the skin is blackened and blistered. Set aside until cool enough to handle.


On a small tray, slice the aubergine open lengthways, spoon out the excess water and seeds. Remove the flesh from the skin with a spoon and place into a large bowl.


Drizzle with your best olive oil and the lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper; then add a pinch of sugar.


Reserve some of the chickpeas, pepper and mint for garnish, then mix in the remaining chickpeas, dates, pepper, mint, coriander, chilli and garlic. Taste and correct the seasoning to your liking.


Spoon the aubergine into the middle of a serving plate and garnish with the feta, flaked almonds, reserved chickpeas, chopped mint and pepper.


Drizzle with balsamic vinegar and a little more olive oil. Top with crisp croûtons and serve.
