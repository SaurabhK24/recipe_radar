Ingredients
For the posset

3 free-range egg yolks
55g/2oz caster sugar
1 lemon, juice only
1 vanilla pod, split open
142ml/5fl oz pot double cream, whipped

For the spun sugar

30g/1oz caster sugar




Method


In a clean bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice and vanilla pod over a saucepan of barely simmering water, until thickened.


Fold through the double cream into the bowl, and then gently pour the mixture into a tall glass.


For the spun sugar, in a small frying pan melt the sugar over a medium heat and when it turns into a deep golden colour, remove from the heat and use a fork to flick back an forth over a greased rolling pin.


To serve, gather the sugar strands together into a ball and top the posset with it.
