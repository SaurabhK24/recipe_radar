Ingredients
For the griddled lamb

1 lamb chop, taken off the bone
1 tsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the succotash

1 corn on the cob, corn removed
100g/3½oz frozen peas
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
100ml/3 ½fl oz double cream

For the scones

200g/7oz self-raising flour
100g/3½ butter
2 free-range eggs
milk to bind
100g/3½oz cheddar, grated
1 large handful fresh basil




Method


Pre-heat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Season the lamb with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then rub with oil.


Heat a griddle pan to smoking. Add the lamb and cook for 4-5 minutes, turning once.


For the succotash, place the corn, frozen peas and garlic in a saucepan with the double cream. Bring to the boil and reduce to a simmer. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and cook for two minutes


For the scones, mix together the flour, butter eggs and add a little milk in a food processor to form a smooth, firm dough.


Roll out some scone dough onto a flat, floured surface. Fold in the cheese (reserving a little for later) and basil and fold the dough over.


Using a medium-sized chefs' ring or cutter, cut out rounds and place onto a baking sheet. Brush with milk and top with the reserved cheese.


Place into the preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until risen and golden.


Serve the scones with the lamb and the succotash.
