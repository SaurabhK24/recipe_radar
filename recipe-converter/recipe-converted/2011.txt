Ingredients

200g/7oz chicken breast, cut into large cubes
600g/1lb 5½oz chicken thighs or wings
1 tbsp harissa paste
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 onion, sliced
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground ginger
1 tsp ground turmeric
1 tsp chilli flakes
450ml/16fl oz lamb stock
100g/3½oz dried apricots, quartered
1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes
1 x 400g tin chickpeas, rinsed, drained
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp freshly chopped mint
2 tbsp freshly chopped parsley

To serve

couscous, cooked according to packet instructions
150g/5½oz Greek-style yoghurt
handful of flaked almonds




Method


Mix the chicken breast and thighs (or wings) with the harissa paste in a bowl until well combined. Cover with cling film and chill in the fridge for two hours.


Heat the vegetable oil in the base of a tagine dish, or heavy-based casserole dish. Fry the chicken for 2-3 minutes. Remove from the dish using a slotted spoon and set aside.


Fry the onion for five minutes, or until soft. Stir in the garlic and spices.


Add the meat back to the dish, along with the stock, apricots and tomatoes. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Bring to the boil, cover with the lid and simmer for one hour. (Add the chickpeas after 45 minutes and stir until well combined.)


Stir in the mint and parsley at the end of cooking.


Serve alongside couscous and Greek-style yoghurt, topped with the almonds.
