These tasty little morsels are too delicious to be reserved for Christmas dinner - try them as a party snack or with roast chicken.

Ingredients

8 thin slices streaky bacon
16 chipolata sausages
cocktail sticks, to secure the bacon




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Place the bacon on a chopping board, then using the side of the knife, stretch and flatten the bacon until about half as long again.


Cut each strip of bacon in half across, then wrap each piece around a chipolata, securing with cocktail sticks.


Place in a roasting tray and roast for 15 minutes until golden-brown and cooked through.
