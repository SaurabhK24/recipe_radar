Paul's version of the classic chocolate fondant is all about timing. Don’t let the puddings bake to the point that their surface begins to crack, as this means the centres are starting to cook.

Ingredients

2-3 tbsp cocoa powder, for dusting
165g/5¾oz dark chocolate (70 percent cocoa solids), chopped into small pieces
165g/5¾oz unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, plus extra for greasing
3 medium free-range eggs
3 medium free-range egg yolks
85g/3oz caster sugar
2 tbsp plain flour
double cream, to serve




Method


Grease six small pudding moulds with butter and dust the insides with cocoa powder, then refrigerate for 30 minutes.


Melt the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water). Set aside to cool slightly.


Using an electric whisk, whisk the eggs, egg yolks and caster sugar together for several minutes until a thick, pale mousse-like consistency.


Carefully fold the cooled melted chocolate and butter into the egg and sugar mix. Finally fold in the flour carefully so as not to knock any air out of the mixture.


Divide the mixture equally between the prepared moulds. Place in the fridge for at least two hours or until firm. You can make the puddings up to 24 hours in advance and leave them in the fridge until you are ready to cook them.


Preheat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/400F/Gas 6. Place the puddings on a baking tray and bake for eight minutes, or until the puddings are risen but not cracked.


Turn out the puddings on to individual plates and serve, with pouring cream.
