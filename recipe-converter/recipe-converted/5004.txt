Ingredients
For the potato wedges

1 tbsp olive oil
1 potato, cut into wedges
½ tsp cayenne pepper
½ tsp chilli flakes

For the chicken

1 tbsp olive oil
1 chicken breast, skin removed
1 tsp balsamic vinegar
1 tsp wholegrain mustard
1 tsp honey
sprig fresh parsley, to garnish




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the potato wedges, heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan, add the potato wedges and sprinkle over the spices. Fry the wedges, stirring frequently, until lightly browned on all sides.


Transfer to the oven and bake for 15 minutes, or until golden-brown and tender.


Meanwhile, for the chicken, heat the oil in another ovenproof frying pan and fry the chicken for 2-3 minutes on each side. Add the balsamic vinegar, mustard and honey and stir to coat the chicken.


Transfer to the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the chicken is completely cooked through.


To serve, place the chicken onto a serving plate with the potato wedges and garnish with parsley.
