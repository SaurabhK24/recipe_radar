Ingredients

1 tsp salt
375g/13oz flour, plus extra for dusting
3 tsp baking powder
200g/7oz of mashed swede
50g/1¾oz leftover vegetables
250ml/9fl oz milk
grated cheese, for topping




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Grease and line a baking tray.


Mix the dry ingredients together and add the vegetables. Gradually add the milk until it forms a stiff dough (you may need more or less milk).


Turn the mixture out onto a lightly floured surface. Pat out to flatten to about 2cm/¾in thick. Use a cutter to stamp out the scones.


Sprinkle each scone with a little cheese and place on the prepared baking tray.


Bake for about 15 minutes until golden-brown.
