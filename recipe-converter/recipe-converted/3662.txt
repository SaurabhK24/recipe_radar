There is no better recipe for using up leftover or stale bits of bread than this. It's also great for using up hot cross buns, croissants, pain au chocolat, fruit bread or tea loaf.





By JB Gill






Ingredients

8 slices of white bread
25g/1oz butter, softened
1 eating apple
2 tbsp raisins or sultanas
500ml/18fl oz milk
2 eggs
25g/1oz caster sugar




Method


Preheat the oven to 170C/150C Fan/Gas 3½.


Remove any hard crusts from the bread, then butter each slice on one side. Cut the slices into triangles.


Peel and core the apple, then cut it into thin slices.


Arrange a layer of the bread triangles on the bottom of a 1.5-litre/2½-pint baking dish, butter side-down. Put a layer of the apple slices on top. Scatter over half the raisins.


Repeat with the remaining bread and apple, adding the raisins as you go. Finish with a layer of bread, butter side-up.


Beat together the milk, eggs and sugar in a jug until combined. Pour the mixture over the bread, pushing down the top layer of bread so it is submerged for the beginning of the soaking period. Leave to stand for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour.


Bake in the oven for 35-45 minutes, or until set with a golden top. Serve warm.




Recipe Tips
For a healthier pudding you can replace the white bread with brown.

  You can flavour the pudding with lots of other ingredients. Try spreading the layers of bread with marmalade or jam, or adding spices such as nutmeg to the milk mixture.
