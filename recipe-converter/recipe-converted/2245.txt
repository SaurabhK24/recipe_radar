Marinating the meat makes all the difference so don't be tempted to skip that step. If you want a lighter curry, swap some of the cream for natural yoghurt.

Ingredients

4 chicken breasts, skinned, boned and cubed
2.5cm/1in piece of fresh root ginger, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 tsp chilli powder
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander, plus extra to garnish
1 lime, juice only
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 onion, finely chopped
1 red chilli, seeds removedand finely chopped
1 tsp ground turmeric
200ml/7fl oz double cream
Â½ lemon

To serve

basmati rice, cooked according to packet instructions
naan bread




Method


Put the chicken breasts in a large bowl and mix with the ginger, garlic, chilli, salt, pepper, coriander, lime juice and 1 tablespoon of the oil. Set aside for at least 5 minutes to allow the flavours to develop.


Heat a heavy-bottomed shallow pan and, when hot, add the chicken. Cook for 8-10 minutes until the chicken is browned on all sides.


Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a large pan and cook the onion and red chilli for 5-6 minutes until golden brown. Add the turmeric and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the cream and cook gently for a couple of minutes.


Add the chicken to the creamy sauce and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Check for seasoning, and add lemon juice to taste.


Garnish with fresh coriander and serve immediately with rice or naan bread.
