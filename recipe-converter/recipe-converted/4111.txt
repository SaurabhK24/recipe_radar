Ingredients

4 X 175g/6oz portions of turbot fillet, skinned
salt and freshly ground black pepper, plus sea salt flakes
flour, for dusting
large knob of butter

For the salad

2 small avocados
2 limes, juice only
2 small mangoes
2 red chillies, de-seeded and finely diced
1 small red onion or 2-3 spring onions, finely chopped
1 heaped tbsp chopped coriander leaves
4 tbsp olive oil




Method


To make the salad, halve the avocados, remove the stone and peel away the skin.


Roughly cut the flesh into 1cm (0.5in) dice, and place in a large bowl.


Squeeze the juice of 1 lime over the avocados, and stir gently.


Peel the mangoes and dice the flesh off the stone.


Place all of the salad ingredients in a bowl, stir them together and season with sea salt before adding the avocados and mangoes.


Season the fish with salt, lightly dusting the filleted side with flour. Melt the butter in a frying pan. Once bubbling, place the fillets in the pan floured side down. Season skin with pepper.


Fry gently for 4-5 minutes, then turn fish in the pan and remove from heat. Leave to stand for a further 2-3 minutes.


Place salad on a plate and serve fish alongside.


Drizzle any remaining butter in the pan over the fish. Serve.
