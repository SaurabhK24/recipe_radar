Ingredients
For the chicken

1 tbsp olive oil
1 chicken breast, skin removed
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 fresh rosemary sprig
2 garlic cloves, peeled, left whole, slightly crushed with the side of a knife
2 tbsp garlic-and-herb cream cheese

For the chickpeas and chorizo

100g/3½oz chorizo, sliced
½ onion, peeled, finely sliced
2 garlic cloves, peeled, finely chopped
1 sprig fresh rosemary
85g/3oz canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan and brown the chicken breast for 2-3 minutes on each side. Add the rosemary and garlic to the frying pan.


Transfer the pan to the oven and cook the chicken for 10-12 minutes.


Spread the garlic-and-herb cream cheese over the top of the chicken. Keep warm.


Meanwhile, for the chickpeas and chorizo, roast the chorizo in the oven in a roasting tray for 3-4 minutes, or until crisp. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Stir the onion, garlic, rosemary and chickpeas into the chorizo and roast for a further 5-7 minutes. Stir in the balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil.


To serve, spoon the chickpeas and chorizo onto a plate. Cut the chicken breast into three pieces and place on top.
