Ingredients
For the filling

4 large Bramley cooking apples (weighing about 900g/2lb)
1 large orange, zest and juice only
2 sprigs rosemary
225g/8oz blackberries
splash of water
30g/1½ oz caster sugar

For the topping

55g/2oz ground almonds
140g/5oz plain flour
85g/3oz polenta (not quick-cook)
140g/5oz butter, cold
110g/4oz light muscovado sugar
splash of water

To serve

thick cream or custard




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the filling, peel, quarter and core the apples and cut into large chunks. Place in a shallow ovenproof dish.


Zest and juice the orange, adding the zest and juice to the apples. Mix together with your hands.


Bruise the rosemary sprigs and scatter over the apples. Toss over the blackberries, add a splash of water and scatter over the sugar.


For the crumble topping, place the almonds, flour, polenta, butter and sugar in a food processor and pulse briefly several times, just to mix. The mixture should look like coarse breadcrumbs.


Tip out into a bowl and add a splash of water. Use a spoon to mix briefly - it should be quite clumpy.


Sprinkle the crumble mixture over the fruit.


Place in the oven and bake for 20 minutes.


Turn down the heat to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and cook for a further 20-25 minutes, until the top is nicely browned and bubbling.


Serve with pouring cream or custard.
