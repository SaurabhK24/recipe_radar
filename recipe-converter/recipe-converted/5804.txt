Ingredients
For the caramel swirl

150g/5½oz caster sugar
290ml/10fl oz warm water

For the lemon posset

175g/6oz mascarpone
2 tbsp icing sugar
1 tbsp ready-made lemon curd
100ml/3½fl oz double cream, whipped
1 tbsp whole milk
2 ready-made shortbread biscuits, crushed
3 tbsp fresh raspberries
mint sprig, to garnish




Method


To make the caramel swirl, place the sugar in a very clean heavy-based saucepan and pour over the warm water. Brush the sides of the saucepan with a pastry brush dipped in water to rinse away any sugar crystals that may have stuck to the sides. Heat over a low heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until all the sugar has dissolved. Turn up the heat and boil until the sugar turns to golden caramel. Dip the base of the pan momentarily in cold water to halt the cooking process, then leave the caramel to stand for a few minutes to allow the caramel to become viscous. Pour a thin line of caramel in a swirl onto oiled baking paper and leave to cool.


For the lemon posset, mix together the mascarpone, icing sugar and lemon curd. Fold in the whipped cream and milk. Put the crushed shortbread biscuits into the bottom of a tall glass, put 2 tablespoons of the raspberries onto the biscuit and then top with a layer of the posset mixture. Top with the remaining raspberries.


To serve, stick the caramel swirl into the glass and garnish with a sprig of mint.
