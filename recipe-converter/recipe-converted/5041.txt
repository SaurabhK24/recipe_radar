Ingredients
For the honey filo cake

85g/3oz butter, melted
6 sheets ready-made filo pastry
2-3 tbsp clear honey

To serve

1 orange, peeled and segmented
150ml/¼ pint double cream, lightly whipped




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Brush a small ovenproof non-stick frying pan or ovenproof dish with melted butter. Place a sheet of filo pastry into the pan or dish and brush with butter. Repeat with two more filo sheets and more melted butter, allowing the pastry to hang over the edge of the pan slightly. Drizzle with honey.


Repeat with the remaining three sheets of filo pastry, brushing with melted butter and drizzling with honey.


Transfer to the oven and bake for five minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown.


To serve, divide the filo cake between two plates and top with orange segments and a dollop of whipped cream.
