Welsh cakes are a traditional tea-time treat that are really easy to make. Eat them warm from the stove, or store in an airtight container for up to a week.

Ingredients

225g/8oz self-raising flour
110g/4oz salted butter, diced
85g/3oz caster sugar, plus extra for dusting
handful of sultanas
1 free-range egg, beaten
milk, if needed
extra butter, for greasing




Method


Sift the flour into a bowl and add the diced butter.


Rub with your fingertips, or pulse in a food processor, until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.


Add the sugar, sultanas and beaten egg and mix well to form a ball of dough, using a splash of milk if needed.


Roll the dough out on a floured board to a thickness of about 5mm/½in.


Cut into rounds with a 7.5–10cm/3-4in plain cutter.


Rub a bakestone or heavy iron griddle with butter, wipe away the excess and place on the hob until it is heated through.


Cook the Welsh cakes a few at a time for 2–3 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown.


Remove from the griddle and dust with caster sugar while still warm.
