A delightful twist on the popular crème brûlée recipe, go luxe with raspberry and chocolate.






By Antony Worrall Thompson


From Saturday Kitchen






Ingredients

600ml/1 pint double cream
½ vanilla pod, split lengthways
80g/3oz plain chocolate, finely chopped
6 large free-range egg yolks
2 tbsp caster sugar, plus extra for sprinkling
100g/3½oz raspberries




Method


Pour the cream into a non-stick saucepan and scrape the tiny seeds from the vanilla pod into the cream with a small knife.


Add the pod and place the cream over a medium heat until almost boiling.


Add the chocolate and whisk until smooth.


Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks with the sugar until combined, but do not overbeat as you do not want it to become light and frothy.


Pour the chocolate cream onto the eggs, stir with a wooden spoon to combine and return to the saucepan.


Cook over a low heat until the custard has thickened, stirring constantly, but do not allow to boil.


Test to see if the custard is ready by running your finger through the custard on the back of a spoon. If the custard stays apart, it is ready.


Divide the raspberries between four large ramekins.


Strain the chocolate custard over the raspberries and allow to cool.


Refrigerate for at least six hours, preferably overnight.


A few minutes before serving sprinkle each custard with a thin layer of caster sugar. Using a mini blowtorch, caramelise the sugar evenly. Once caramelised do not refrigerate. (If you don't have a blowtorch, preheat your grill to high and flash the crème brulées for a few seconds until the sugar caramelises.)
