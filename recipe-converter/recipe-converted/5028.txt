Also known as cinder toffee this light, crunchy sweet is a must on bonfire night and a perfect addition to ice cream.







By Lorraine Pascale


From Baking Made Easy






Ingredients

1tbsp vegetable oil, for oiling baking tray


80g/3oz butter
160g/5½oz caster sugar
80g/3oz golden syrup
2 tsp bicarbonate of soda




Method


Grease a 20cm/8in square baking tin with vegetable oil.


Gently heat the butter, sugar and golden syrup in a large heavy-based pan until the sugar has dissolved. Turn up the heat and boil rapidly, without stirring. If the mixture goes darker at one side of the mix, then gently swirl the pan to mix it all together. Keep boiling until the mixture goes a golden-brown colour – this will take about 5 minutes.


Add the bicarbonate of soda and stir it for a few seconds, which will make the mixture expand and fizz (take care, the mixture will expand a lot). Tip the honeycomb into the oiled baking tin and leave until cold and set.


To serve, cut the honeycomb into pieces and stir into ice creams or decorate puddings. You can put the honeycomb in a food processor and sprinkle it over desserts.




Recipe Tips
To stop the honeycomb mixture from burning, dip a pastry brush in some water and brush the sides of the pan to remove any sugar.
