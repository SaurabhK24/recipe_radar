Ingredients

300g/10oz dried penne pasta
500g/1lb 2oz broccoli, cut into florets
110g/4oz butter
75g/3oz flaked almonds
50g/2oz white breadcrumbs
1 lemon, juice only
parmesan (or a vegetarian alternative), to serve




Method


Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Add the pasta and cook according to packet instructions.


Meanwhile, bring a separate pan of salted water to the boil. Add the broccoli and boil for 2-3 minutes, until just tender. Drain the broccoli into a colander.


Heat a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the butter and fry until it melts and begins to turn golden-brown.


Add the almonds and breadcrumbs and heat until the breadcrumbs are golden-brown.


Add the broccoli and stir well to coat in the almonds and breadcrumbs.


Add the lemon juice and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Add the cooked penne pasta and mix together well.


To serve, spoon equal portions of the pasta and broccoli into bowls and garnish with freshly grated parmesan.
