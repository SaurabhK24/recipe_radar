Ingredients
For the biscuit base

175g/6oz ginger biscuits, crushed
150g/5oz butter, melted

For the topping

1.2kg/2½lb full-fat ricotta
150g/5oz caster sugar
6 free-range eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract
250g/9oz lemon curd
1 tbsp poppy seeds

For the syrup

200g/7oz caster sugar
150ml/5fl oz white wine
250g/9oz raspberries, fresh or frozen
1 tbsp rose water
double cream, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 175C/350F/Gas 4.


Mix the ginger biscuits and melted butter in a bowl until well combined. Press into a 22cm/9in springform cake tin and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.


For the topping, blend the ricotta, sugar, eggs and vanilla extract in a food processor until smooth.


Spoon the mixture into a bowl then gently fold in the lemon curd and poppy seeds. Spoon this mixture into the cake tin on top of the chilled biscuit base.


Cook the cheesecake in the oven for one hour, depending on your oven. The cheesecake is cooked when springy to the touch and just set in the middle.


For the syrup, place the sugar, 100ml/3½fl oz water and wine in a saucepan and bring gently to a simmer until all the sugar dissolves. Allow to boil for five minutes, or until thickened.


Add the raspberries and rose water to the syrup, remove the pan from the heat and set aside. Once cooled, blend the sauce in a food processor until smooth and then pass through a fine sieve.


Serve the cheesecake with the sauce and some double cream.
