Okay, so you don't get the buttery flavour, but you do get a lovely, creamy-smooth, milky white sauce which is most helpful for those needing to cut the fat content of their diet.






By Delia Smith






Ingredients

10fl oz/275ml milk - this can be infused but must be cold
¾oz/20g sauce/plain flour
salt and freshly milled black pepper




Method


All you do to make this sauce is place the milk in a small saucepan, then simply add the sauce flour and, over a medium heat, bring everything gradually up to simmering point, whisking vigorously and continuously with a balloon whisk until the sauce has thickened to a smooth, rich creaminess. Then add seasoning and allow it to cook very gently forminutes on the lowest possible heat.
