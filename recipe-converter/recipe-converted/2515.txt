Ingredients

200ml/7fl oz double cream, whipped
140g/5oz quark cheese (or other soft cheese)
1 tbsp caster sugar
2 slices ready-made Madeira cake
2 tbsp white wine
100g/3½oz tinned cherries, stones removed
mint leaf, to garnish




Method


Place the cream, quark and caster sugar into a bowl and mix together well.


Using a deep chefs' ring, cut out two rounds from the Madeira cake slices. Press one round of the Madeira cake into the base of the chefs' ring on a plate and drizzle with the white wine.


Add half the cream and quark mixture into the chefs' ring, then add a layer of cherries. Then press the other Madeira round into the ring and top with another layer of the cream and quark mixture, finishing with the cherries on top.


Carefully remove the chefs' ring and garnish with a mint leaf.
