Ingredients

4 tbsp ricotta
4 tbsp lemon curd
caster sugar, to dust
knob of butter
4 ready-made crêpes




Method


Preheat the grill to a medium setting.


Place 1 tbsp of ricotta cheese and 1 tbsp lemon curd in the center of each of four ready- made crêpes.


Fold up to make triangular packets open at the top.


Place these in an ovenproof dish and spinkle on a little caster sugar. Dot with butter and cook under a medium grill, until the butter melts and the sugar crisps. Serve at once.
