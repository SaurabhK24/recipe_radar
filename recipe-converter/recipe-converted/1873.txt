Yes that’s cheese scone, not just puny cheese scones. One great big mound of cheesiness to be broken into smaller pieces after it’s cooked. Who can resist?






By Nigel Slater


From Nigel Slater's Dish of the Day






Ingredients

450g/1lb plain flour, plus extra for dusting
4 tsp baking powder
85g/3oz cold butter, cubed
350ml/12fl oz milk, plus extra for glazing
250g/9oz assorted cheeses, crumbled into small pieces, plus extra grated cheese to sprinkle on top




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Sift the flour and baking powder into a large mixing bowl.


Rub the butter into the flour using your fingertips, until the mixture resembles coarse, fresh breadcrumbs.


Pour in the milk and mix with a wooden spoon to create a soft dough.


Add the crumbled cheese and ensure it is evenly distributed by gently kneading the dough with your hands.


Shape the dough into a rough round and place on a baking tray dusted with flour.


Press down on the top of the ball to flatten it slightly, then brush it with a little milk to glaze.


Grate some extra cheese over the top, then score a deep cross into the dough with a sharp knife to allow it to break into individual pieces when cooked.


Bake in the preheated oven for around 30 minutes, or until the cheese topping looks golden-brown and crisp.


Serve warm with your favourite chutney or pickle.
