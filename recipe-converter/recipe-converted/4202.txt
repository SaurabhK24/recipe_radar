Ingredients

large knob of butter
4 dessert apples, peeled and sliced
1 tbsp light muscovado sugar
4-6 tbsp fresh custard

For the crumble topping

large knob of butter
50g/2oz jumbo porridge oats
1 tbsp desiccated coconut
25g/1oz pecan nuts, roughly chopped
pinch ground cinnamon
2 tbsp light muscovado sugar
1 tbsp sunflower oil
1-2 tbsp maple syrup




Method


Heat two large non-stick frying pans and add a knob of butter to each. Once melted add the apple slices and sugar to one pan and cook for 3-4 minutes until softened.


Add the porridge oats, coconut, pecan, cinnamon and light muscovado to the other and cook for 3-4 minutes over a high heat until golden - add the oil if the mixture feels too dry.


Once the apples have softened, stir in the custard, warm through, then divide between two serving dishes. Stir the maple syrup into the crumble, then spoon over the apple custard. Serve warm.
