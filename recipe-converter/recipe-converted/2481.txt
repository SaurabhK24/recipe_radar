Ingredients

225g/8oz soft brown sugar
225g/8oz butter
2 tbsp golden syrup
350g/12oz whole oats
3 tbsp chopped ginger in syrup
110g/4oz chocolate chips




Method


Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.


Place the sugar, butter and golden syrup together in a saucepan and heat gently until the butter has melted, stirring occasionally. Take the saucepan off the heat and stir in the oats, ginger and chocolate chips, mixing thoroughly.


Pour the mixture into a lined and lightly greased tin and press it out evenly using the back of a wooden spoon. Bake in the centre of the oven for 40-50 minutes.


Allow the mixture to cool in the tin for 10 minutes before cutting into oblong bars. Leave the flapjacks in the tin until they cool, then remove.
