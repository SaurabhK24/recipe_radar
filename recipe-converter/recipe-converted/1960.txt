Ingredients
For the chermoula tofu

25g/1oz coriander, finely chopped
3 garlic cloves, chopped
1 tsp cumin seeds, lightly crushed
1 lemon, finely grated rind
½ tsp dried crushed chillies
1 tbsp olive oil
250g/9oz tofu

For the roasted vegetables

2 red onions, quartered
2 courgettes, thickly sliced
2 red peppers, deseeded and sliced
2 yellow peppers, deseeded and sliced
1 small aubergine, thickly sliced
low-calorie cooking spray
pinch salt




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/ Gas 6.


For the chermoula, mix the coriander, garlic, cumin, lemon rind and chillies together with the oil and a little salt in a small bowl.


Pat the tofu dry on kitchen paper and cut it in half. Cut each half horizontally into thin slices. Spread the chermoula generously over the slices.


Scatter the vegetables in a roasting tin and spray with oil. Bake for about 45 minutes, until lightly browned, turning the ingredients once or twice during cooking.


Arrange the tofu slices over the vegetables, with the side spread with the chermoula uppermost, and bake for a further 10-15 minutes, or until the tofu is lightly coloured.


Divide the tofu and vegetables between four plates and serve.
