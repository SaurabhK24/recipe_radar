Ingredients
For the avocado dip

1 avocado, peeled and stone removed
½ lemon, juice only, or to taste
2 tomatoes, chopped
pinch chilli flakes, to taste
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the olive tapenade

2 tbsp capers, rinsed
100g/3½oz black olives, stones removed
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
3 tbsp olive oil
1 lemon, zest only
handful fresh flatleaf parsley

For the griddled garlic pittas

2 garlic cloves, chopped
3 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
6 ready-made mini pittas




Method


For the avocado dip, place half of the avocado into a food processor with the lemon juice and blend until smooth. Transfer to a bowl.


Chop the rest of the avocado into small cubes and mix into the blended avocado. Add the chopped tomatoes and chilli flakes and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Taste and add more lemon juice and chilli if needed. Place the dip into a small serving bowl.


For the olive tapenade, place all the tapenade ingredients into a small food processor and blend until almost smooth. Place into a small serving bowl.


For the griddled garlic pittas, place the garlic and olive oil into a small bowl, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix well.


Brush the pittas with the garlic oil. Heat a griddle pan until smoking hot and griddle the pittas on both sides.


To serve, place the griddled pittas onto a serving plate and serve with the avocado dip and the olive tapenade.
