This unusual jam is excellent with anything from hot buttered toast through to warm creamy rice pudding.






By Dan Lepard






Ingredients

100g/3½oz carrot, grated, peeled
600g/1lb 5oz fresh apricots
5cm/2in piece fresh ginger, peeled, grated
400g/14oz granulated or caster sugar
1 small lemon, juice only
50g/2oz chopped almonds




Method


Place the grated carrot into a lidded saucepan with about 300ml/½ pint water, bring to the boil and then cook until the carrot threads are falling apart and the water has mostly evaporated.


Meanwhile, halve the apricots, remove the stones and place the flesh in the pan with the carrots. Cover with a lid and cook for five minutes, stirring occasionally, until the fruit starts to break down and fall apart.


Add the ginger to the pan and cook with the lid off until most of the remaining moisture has evaporated.


Add the sugar and lemon juice, bring to the boil and cook until the mixture reaches 105C/220F on a sugar thermometer. Stir the jam as it’s cooking, especially around the edges, as it sometimes catches and burns on the bottom.


Stir in the almonds.


Leave the apricot jam for a few minutes to cool; then ladle into hot, clean jars and seal immediately.
