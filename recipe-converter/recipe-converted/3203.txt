These flavoursome aubergines are the perfect accompaniment to sweet or fruity main courses.






By Levi Roots






Ingredients

6 tbsp olive oil
2 onions, peeled, finely chopped
4 cloves garlic, peeled, chopped
1 green pepper, seeds removed, chopped
1 red pepper, seeds removed, chopped
3 large aubergines, cut into cubes
¼ tbsp hot paprika
¼ tbsp sweet paprika
2 tsp ground cumin
800g/1lb 12¼oz canned cherry tomatoes
½ tsp soft light brown sugar
salt and freshly ground black pepper

To serve

2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley leaves
8 lime wedges




Method


Heat two tablespoons of the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the chopped onions, garlic and peppers and fry in the oil, stirring well, until softened, about 3-4 minutes.


Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a sauté pan or casserole and fry the aubergine cubes, in batches, for 4-6 minutes, or until golden-brown all over. Remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and set aside on a warmed plate. Repeat the process with the remaining batches of aubergine cubes.


Stir the hot paprika, sweet paprika and cumin into the onion mixture and cook for one minute, or until the spices are fragrant. Add the canned tomatoes, sugar and cooked aubergines, and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Pour 350ml/12½fl oz water into the pan, stir well and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the mixture has thickened and is cooked through.


Serve the Creole aubergines sprinkled with chopped parsley and garnished with wedges of lime.
