Ingredients
For tortillas

500ml/18fl oz vegetable oil
2 ready-made flour tortillas, cut into triangles

For the tapenade

100g/3½oz black olives, stones removed
pinch dried chilli flakes
2 tsp chopped fresh coriander
2 tsp chopped fresh chives
2 tsp olive oil
1 tsp tomato purée
1 garlic clove
½ tsp Tabasco sauce
¼ lemon, juice only
salt and freshly ground black pepper

To garnish

lemon wedge
fresh flatleaf parsley leaf




Method


To make the tortillas, heat the oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended!)


Carefully place the tortilla triangles into the oil and deep-fry until golden, then carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


To make the tapenade, place all of the tapenade ingredients into a food processor and blend to a coarse paste.


To serve, place the tapenade in a small bowl in the centre of a plate with the tortilla crisps around. Garnish with the lemon wedge and a flatleaf parsley leaf.
