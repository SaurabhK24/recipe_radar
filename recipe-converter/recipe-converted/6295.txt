Ingredients

6 egg whites, at room temperature
350g/12oz caster sugar
300ml/½ pint clotted cream
900g/2lb fresh small strawberries




Method


Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.


Put the egg whites into a large clean bowl and whisk to form soft peaks. Add 110g/4oz of the sugar and continue to whisk.


Gradually add another 110g/4oz of sugar, a spoonful at a time, until the mixture forms stiff peaks.


Gently fold in the remaining sugar.


Shape 20 large spoonfuls of the meringue onto 2 baking sheets lined with non-stick baking paper and bake in the oven for 15 minutes.


Lower the oven temperature to 110C/225F/Gas ¼ and cook for a further 2-3 hours until very crisp and dry.


Leave to cool, then store in an air tight tin.


Serve with the clotted cream and strawberries
