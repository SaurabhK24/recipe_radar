Ingredients

40g/1½oz cobnuts, shelled and finely chopped
50g/2oz breadcrumbs
2 x 125g/4½oz Crottin de Chavignol goats’ cheese
2 white peaches, halved, stones removed
1 tbsp honey, plus extra for drizzling
few shavings fresh black truffle
150g/5½oz mascarpone
100g/3½oz frisée (curly endive)
100g/3½oz red chard
alfalfa sprouts, to garnish




Method


Pre-heat the grill to medium-high heat.


In a bowl, combine the chopped cobnuts with the breadcrumbs.


Cut the goats’ cheeses on a diagonal in half and roll in the cobnut breadcrumbs.


Place the halved peaches onto a baking tray and drizzle with honey. Grill until golden-brown.


Meanwhile, grate a little black truffle into the mascarpone and mix until well combined.


Toss together the frisée with the red chard and divide among four serving plates. Place a slice of the goats’ cheese and half a peach on top of each plate. Drizzle a little more honey over, finish with a dollop of the truffled mascarpone and a sprinkle of alfalfa sprouts.
