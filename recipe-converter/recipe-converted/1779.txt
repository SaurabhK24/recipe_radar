Ingredients
For the duck

125g/4½oz duck breast
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the sauce

100g/3½oz blackberries
1 tbsp red wine vinegar
50ml/2fl oz red wine
1 tbsp brown sugar
salt and freshly ground black pepper

To serve

50g/2oz sprouting broccoli, blanched and seasoned with salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


To make the duck, heat an ovenproof griddle pan over a medium heat. Season the duck breast on both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then place skin-side down onto the hot griddle to cook for 4-5 minutes. Turn the breast over and transfer to the oven to roast for 8-10 minutes, or until completely cooked through.


To make the sauce, place all the sauce ingredients into a frying pan and bring to simmer. Simmer for 5-6 minutes to reduce and thicken.


To serve, place the blanched broccoli into the centre of a large warm plate. Place the duck breast on top, then spoon the sauce around.
