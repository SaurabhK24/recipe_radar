Ingredients

½ pineapple, core removed, stalk intact
1 orange, peeled, segmented
½ red chilli, finely chopped
squeeze lime juice
2 free-range egg whites
150g/5½oz caster sugar
lime wedges, to garnish




Method


Preheat the grill to medium.


Place the cored pineapple onto a baking sheet, scoop out some of the pineapple flesh to make a cavity and finely chop the scooped-out pineapple flesh. Mix the chopped pineapple with orange segments, chopped chilli and lime juice and spoon back into the pineapple cavity.


Whisk the egg whites, adding the sugar one tablespoon at a time until it is all incorporated and the mix is glossy and stiff (be careful not to over-beat the mixture). Scoop the meringue mixture into a piping bag and pipe on top of the fruit in the cavity. Place under the grill and cook until golden-brown on top.


To serve, brown the meringue further with a mini-blow torch and serve.
