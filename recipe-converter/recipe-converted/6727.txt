Ingredients

200g/7oz medium egg noodles
30g/1oz butter
30g/1oz plain flour
salt and freshly ground black pepper
150ml/¼ pint milk
55g/2oz cheddar, grated
sprig fresh parsley, to garnish




Method


Preheat the grill to its highest setting.


Place the noodles into a large heatproof bowl and pour over enough boiling water to cover. Leave for 4-5 minutes, or until softened, then drain.


Heat the butter in a small pan and add the flour, stirring well. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Add the milk gradually, stirring continuously. Bring the sauce to the boil and simmer for 3-4 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in half the cheese.


Pour the sauce over the noodles and mix well, then spoon the noodles into a small ovenproof dish and sprinkle over the remaining cheese.


Place under the hot grill for 1-2 minutes, or until golden-brown.


To serve, garnish with a sprig of parsley.
