Ingredients
For the fritters

110g/4oz self-raising flour
1 tbsp bicarbonate of soda
1 tbsp chilli flakes
sparkling water
1 tbsp oil

For the jam

30g/1oz caster sugar
2 tbsp water
½ tsp chilli flakes
3 spring onions, finely sliced
1 tbsp white wine vinegar
1 tbsp ground coriander




Method


For the fritters, place the dry ingredients into a bowl and mix together. Add enough sparkling water to make a thick pancake batter.


Heat the oil in a frying pan over a high heat, drop spoonfuls of the fritter mixture into the pan and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side, until golden.


For the jam, melt the sugar in a small pan with the water and chilli, over a medium heat and cook until golden.


Add the spring onions, vinegar and coriander and simmer for two minutes.


To serve, place the fritters on to a serving plate, and place the chilli jam on the side.
