Ingredients
For the custard mixture

150ml/5½oz whole milk
150ml/5½oz double cream
1 vanilla pod, seeds scraped out
2 free-range egg yolks
2 tbsp caster sugar

For the pudding

4 thick slices of ready-made brioche
50g/1¾oz unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing
icing sugar, for sprinkling




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the custard, place the milk, cream, vanilla seeds and pods into a saucepan and bring to a scalding point, then take off the heat.


In a bowl mix the egg yolks and sugar together. Gradually add the vanilla cream mixture, whisking continuously.


For the pudding, spread the ready-made brioche with the butter on both sides.


Grease an ovenproof dish with butter and pour over the custard mixture. Place into the oven to bake for 12 minutes, or until the custard has set.


To serve, sprinkle the pudding with icing sugar.
