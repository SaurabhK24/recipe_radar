Trifle's not just for Christmas - James Martin's cherry-topped version is perfect for a summer gathering.






By James Martin


From James Martin's Food Map of Britain






Ingredients

100g/3½oz caster sugar
1.5kg/3lb 5oz cherries, stoned
100ml/3½fl oz cherry brandy
2 litres/3½ pints double cream, whipped
600ml/20fl oz fresh vanilla custard, cooled
2 Madeira cakes, sliced
50g/1¾oz white chocolate, grated

To decorate

100g/3½oz caster sugar
12-20 cherries on stalks, to decorate




Method


Make a sugar syrup by heating the caster sugar with 100ml/3½fl oz water until the sugar has completely dissolved. Set aside to cool slightly.


Put the cherries in a large pan with 50ml/2fl oz of the sugar syrup and half the cherry brandy. Cook for 5-10 minutes, then set aside to cool.


Whisk together half the cream and all the custard.


Soak the cake slices in the remaining brandy and 50ml/2fl oz sugar syrup.


In a large serving bowl, create the layers. First add the cherries, then the soaked cake and top with the cream and custard mixture.


Put the remaining whipped cream in a piping bag and pipe swirls onto the top of the trifle. Cover with the grated chocolate.


To decorate, melt the sugar into a non-stick pan set over a medium heat. Keep heating until a dark-brown caramel forms (CAUTION: Do not leave unattended), then immediately dunk the pan in cold water to prevent the caramel burning.


Carefully dip the cherries into the caramel and place on a silicone mat or non-stick baking parchment to cool completely. When cool decorate the trifle with them.




Recipe Tips
If you don't have a piping bag you can use a clean plastic food bag instead. Simply spoon the cream into a corner, twist the open end to seal and snip off the tip.
