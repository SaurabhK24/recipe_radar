Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease and line a 23cm/9in square cake tin.


In a bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed. Gradually fold in sugar. Fold in the egg yolks one at a time.


In another bowl mix the flour, baking powder, milk and vanilla. Fold this quickly into the egg mix and pour into the cake tin.


Place in the preheated oven and bake for about 30-40 minutes.


For the sauce, beat together the condensed milk, evaporated milk and cream.


As soon as you take the cake out of the oven skewer holes all over the top and pour over half of the milk mix.


Place in the fridge to chill.


Once chilled pour over the rest of the sauce, slice and serve with the strawberries, rasberries and blueberries.
