A simple omelette transformed into a meal for two with herbs, spinach and tangy goats’ cheese.






By Nigel Slater


From Nigel Slater's Dish of the Day






Ingredients

4 free-range eggs
1 tbsp fresh thyme
few basil leaves
50g/1¾oz butter, plus extra for frying
100g/3½oz spinach (a large handful)
150g/5½oz goats’ cheese, sliced
1 tsp chopped rosemary




Method


Whisk the eggs in a bowl and season well. Tear the thyme and basil leaves and add to the egg.


Melt the butter in a non-stick pan. Add the spinach and cook for about one minute until the leaves soften. Add the spinach to the bowl with the eggs.


Place a thin slice of butter in the pan. When it starts to sizzle add the eggs. Add the sliced goats’ cheese and rosemary and cook on a low to moderate heat.


Preheat the grill on a high setting.


After six minutes of frying, finish under the grill until golden on top and serve.
