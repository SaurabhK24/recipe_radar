Ingredients
For the chocolate cherry brownies

110g/4oz butter, softened, plus extra for greasing
110g/4oz caster sugar
2 free-range eggs
110g/4oz self-raising flour
45g/1¾oz cocoa powder
1 tbsp milk
100g/3½oz canned cherries, stones removed, drained

For the cherry chocolate sauce

150ml/¼ pint double cream
1 tbsp caster sugar
50ml/2fl oz cherry juice (from can of cherries)
2 tbsp cocoa powder
icing sugar, to dust




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the brownies, place the softened butter and sugar in a large bowl and mix together until light and fluffy.


Crack in the eggs and beat well, then fold in the flour, cocoa powder and milk. Finally fold in the cherries.


Line a 20cm/8in x 12cm/5in baking tin with baking paper and grease well with butter. Pour the brownie mixture into the tin.


Transfer to the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until well risen but still slightly gooey in the middle. Remove from the oven and allow to cool, then cut into squares.


For the cherry chocolate sauce, place all of the sauce ingredients (except the icing sugar) into a small pan and heat gently, stirring frequently, until combined to make a smooth sauce.


To serve, place the brownies onto a serving plate and pour over the chocolate sauce. Dust with icing sugar.
