This is a great comfort food for the late autumn and winter months. A warming meal in a bowl, cheap to make and feds a crowd. Serve with crusty bread and butter and a smear of English mustard on the rib.

Ingredients

1 tbsp vegetable oil
4 carrots, 2 finely chopped, 2 diced
1 onion, finely chopped
1 large stick celery, finely chopped
1kg/2lb 4oz flat rib, or short ribs (including the bone)
125g/4½oz pearl barley
125g/4½oz split peas
2 bay leaves
salt and freshly ground black pepper
100g/3½oz lentils
1 leek, sliced
1 small turnip, cut into 1cm/½in dice
2 medium potatoes, cut into 1cm/½in dice




Method


Heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add the two finely chopped carrots, the onion and celery and cook for five minutes, or until soft. Add the flat ribs and 3 litres/5¼ pints of boiling water to the pan.


Bring back to the boil and add the pearl barley, split peas and bay leaves. Place a lid on the saucepan and reduce the heat. Simmer with the lid on for 1½ hours.


Taste and add a good pinch of salt and pepper, to taste. Add the lentils and cook for a further 20 minutes, making sure to replace the lid.


After 20 minutes, add the leeks, the reserved diced carrot, the turnip and the potatoes and cook for a further 20 minutes, or until tender.


Adjust the seasoning by adding salt and pepper if required.


Remove the flat ribs from the pan and set aside on a warm plate.


Ladle the broth into serving bowls and carve a piece of flat rib from the bone and place on top of the broth.
