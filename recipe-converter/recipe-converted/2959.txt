Ingredients

4 garlic cloves, diced
2 long red chillies, diced
2½cm/1in piece fresh root ginger, peeled and diced
4 tbsp sunflower oil
4 crabs (about 1.5kg/3lb 5oz each)
4 tbsp tomato ketchup
1 tsp Marmite, or similar yeast extract
4 tbsp dark soy sauce
4 spring onions, julienned
2 tbsp chopped coriander




Method


Heat a saucepan of water on the hob and place a steamer on top.


Place the garlic, chilli, ginger and sunflower oil in a small bowl and mix.


Chop up the crab, remove the brown meat and discard the dead man’s fingers (gills). Place the meat in the steamer for 4-5 minutes.


Meanwhile, add two tablespoons of the flavoured oil to a wok set over a high heat. Fry without colouring, then add the tomato ketchup, yeast extract and soy sauce. When it starts to caramelise, add the crab and toss until coated.


Add 150ml/5fl oz water, cover with a lid and cook for a further three minutes.


Remove from the heat, add the spring onion and coriander and serve immediately.
