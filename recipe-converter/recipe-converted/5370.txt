Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
3 Jerusalem artichokes, peeled and sliced
½ shallot, peeled and sliced
30ml/1fl oz white wine
100ml/3½fl oz vegetable stock
55ml/2fl oz double cream

For the pheasant garnish

1 tbsp olive oil
2 pheasant thighs
2 tbsp olive oil
½ shallot, peeled and finely sliced




Method


Heat the oil in a medium saucepan. Add the artichokes and shallot and sauté for a few minutes, to soften.


Add the white wine and heat for a further two minutes.


Pour in the vegetable stock, bring to the boil and then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 10-15 minutes.


Add the cream and then, using a hand blender, blend until smooth.


Meanwhile, for the pheasant garnish, heat one tablespoon of olive oil in a separate pan. Add the pheasant thighs and cook for 4-5 minutes on each side, until crisp and thoroughly cooked.


In a separate pan, add the sliced shallot and sauté for 3-4 minutes until golden and crisp.


To serve, ladle the soup into a bowl. Place the pheasant thighs in the middle and scatter the crispy shallots on top.
