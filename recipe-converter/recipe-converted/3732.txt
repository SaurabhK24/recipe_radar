This is a British twist on a French classic: yeast cakes drenched in elderflower vodka rather than rum. A naughty picnic treat?

From Country Show Cook Off






Ingredients

150g/5fl oz plain flour
20g/¾oz caster sugar
½ tsp sea salt flakes
1 x 7g sachet easy-blend dried yeast
½ orange, juice only
3 large free-range eggs, lightly whisked
75g/2½oz butter, softened and cut into cubes, plus extra for greasing
100g/3½z raisins

To serve

lemon zest, grated
elderflower vodka, to taste




Method


Put the flour, sugar, salt into a bowl and mix thoroughly. Then stir in the yeast.


Warm the orange juice slightly in a pan.


Gently stir the eggs into the flour mixture a little at a time, alternating with the warm orange juice and the butter.


Add the raisins and give it a good mix until it forms a smooth dough.


Spoon the mixture into two greased bun tins, dariole moulds or 11cm/4½in baba tins (savarin moulds).


Cover lightly with a tea towel and leave in a warm place for about an hour, or until doubled in size and lightly spongy.


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes until risen and golden-brown.


Remove from the oven and leave to cool on a wire rack.


To transport for a picnic, put into a preserve jar with some lemon zest and drizzle, to taste, with elderflower vodka.
