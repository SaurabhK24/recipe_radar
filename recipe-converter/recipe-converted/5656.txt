Ingredients
For the soup

50g/2oz unsalted butter
½ onion, finely sliced
1 garlic clove, chopped
1 leek, trimmed and chopped
1 potato, peeled and chopped
150ml/4½fl oz hot vegetable stock

For the spicy bacon

50g/2oz bacon lardons, or chopped smoked bacon
1 garlic clove, chopped
1 tsp smoked paprika
salt and freshly ground black pepper
sprig fresh chervil, to garnish




Method


For the leek and potato soup, heat the butter in a pan and sauté the onion, garlic and leek until softened.


Add the potato and stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for ten minutes, or until the potato is tender. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.


Pour the soup into a blender and blend until smooth.


For the spicy pork fat, heat the pork fat in a pan with the garlic and paprika. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and fry gently until the fat has rendered and the texture is crisp. Remove the fat pieces with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


To serve, pour the soup into a bowl, top with the spicy pork fat and garnish with chervil.
