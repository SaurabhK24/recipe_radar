Ingredients

500ml/1lb 1oz high-quality ice cream
300g/10½oz chocolate (70% cocoa)




Method


Using a melon baller, form the ice cream into small balls and place them on a metal baking tray.


When the tray is full, transfer to the freezer and leave overnight. The ice cream balls should be very hard.


Melt the chocolate in a glass bowl placed over a pot of gently boiling water.


When the chocolate has melted, remove from the heat and allow to cool for approximately 10 minutes. The chocolate should be cool to the touch, but not set.


One by one, dip in the ice cream balls and place them back on the tray.


When all the balls are coated with chocolate, return them to the freezer for a further two hours before serving.
