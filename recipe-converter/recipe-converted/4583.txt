Ingredients
For the salad

1 pear cut into quarters, cored and skin left on
50g/1¾oz fresh flatleaf parsley, chopped
50g/1¾oz fresh chervil, chopped
50g/1¾oz fresh chives, chopped
50g/1¾oz cherry tomatoes, chopped
100g/3½oz Stilton cheese, crumbled
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the spinach pesto

55g/2oz baby spinach leaves
3 tbsp olive oil
1 garlic clove
100g/3½oz pine nuts
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Heat a griddle pan until smoking. Add the pear quarters and griddle on both sides for one minute to create grill lines, then remove from the heat and set aside.


For the pesto, place the spinach, olive oil, garlic and pine nuts in a food processor and blend together. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and transfer to a serving bowl.


For the salad, place the parsley, chervil, chives and tomatoes in a large bowl. Mix well and drizzle with the spinach pesto.


Serve in a bowl with the Stilton crumbled over and the pear quarters placed around.
