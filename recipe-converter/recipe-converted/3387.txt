Ingredients

4-5 tbsp vegetable oil
1 onion, peeled, sliced
1 garlic clove, peeled, chopped
1 chilli, seeds removed, finely chopped
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp curry powder
1 tsp fenugreek seeds
pinch salt
2 aubergines, trimmed, cut into 2cm/¾in cubes
1 lime, juice only

To serve

4 pieces crusty bread, toasted in a ridged griddle pan
1 tbsp Greek-style yoghurt
1-2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander leaves




Method


Heat 1-2 tablespoons of the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion, garlic and chilli and fry for 6-8 minutes, or until softened and golden-brown. Remove from the pan and set aside.


Sprinkle the spices and salt onto a plate and mix well to combine. Brush the aubergine cubes with another tablespoon of oil, then dredge them in the spice mixture, until coated.


Heat the remaining oil in the pan and fry the coated aubergine cubes for 4-5 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until tender and golden-brown.


Return the onion mixture to the pan and stir well to combine. Squeeze over the lime juice.


To serve, place one piece of griddled bread into the centre of each of four serving plates. Spoon over the spiced aubergine. Serve a dollop of the Greek-style yoghurt alongside. Sprinkle over the coriander leaves.
