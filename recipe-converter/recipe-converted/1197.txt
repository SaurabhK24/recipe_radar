Ingredients

100g/3½oz broad beans, podded
3-4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 lemon, juice only
1 garlic clove, crushed
pinch chilli flakes
175g/6oz wild rice, cooked according to packet instructions
1 ripe avocado, peeled, stone removed, sliced
3 spring onions, sliced
4 radishes, sliced
2-3 handfuls micro cress




Method


Cook the broad beans in a pan of boiling water for 3-5 minutes. Drain and refresh in cold water. When cool enough to handle, remove the skin from each bean, use your nail to slit the skin, then pop out the bright green bean.


Whisk the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic and chilli flakes together in a bowl and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Mix the wild rice, broad beans, avocado, spring onions and radishes together in a bowl, add the dressing and toss gently. Add the micro cress, give the salad one further toss and serve.




Recipe Tips
Add some chicken or chargrilled slices of haloumi.
