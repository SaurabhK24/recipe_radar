Not the traditional fritter, but a more healthy mix of vegetables fried in spices – equally good as a side dish as it is a breakfast treat.

Ingredients
For the breakfast bhaji

250g/9oz potatoes, peeled and cut into 1.5 cm cubes
250g/9oz carrots, cut into 2cm x 1cm batons
50ml/2fl oz vegetable oil
2 tsp black mustard seeds
1 medium red onion, finely chopped
1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
½ tsp turmeric
2 tomatoes, chopped
½ tsp salt
1 tsp garam masala
4-6 free-range eggs, fried, to serve
Naan breads, to serve




Method


Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water for about 10 minutes, or until tender. Remove with a slotted spoon, set aside, then cook the carrots in the same water for about three minutes, or until just tender but still with a bit of crunch.


Heat the oil in a heavy-based saucepan or karahi and fry the mustard seeds until they start to pop. Add the onion and fry over a moderate heat for five minutes, or until softened. Add the chilli powder and turmeric and fry for 30 seconds, then add the potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, salt, garam masala and 50ml/2fl oz water. Cook for 3-5 minutes, stirring to break up the potatoes a bit, until the tomatoes are reduced and jammy.


To serve, brush the Indian bread with a little melted ghee, butter or vegetable oil if you like, or leave plain. Serve the bhaji with naan breads and a fried egg.




Recipe Tips
You can easily buy garam masala instead of making your own – just ensure it’s fresh for the best flavour. The recipe makes more than you will need but any excess can be stored in a sealed container out of sunlight; it will keep its most aromatic condition for a month.
