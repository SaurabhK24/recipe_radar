This classic Italian dish is a great way to use leftover potatoes and vegetables. Try making it with the kids.

Ingredients

sunflower oil, for greasing
100g/3½oz boiled potatoes, chilled and crushed
2 fresh asparagus spears, trimmed, chopped
1 spring onion, trimmed, chopped
2 heaped tbsp frozen peas
5 fresh mint leaves, torn
2 tbsp grated parmesan
2 free-range eggs, beaten
pinch freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Grease an ovenproof dish with a little sunflower oil.


In a bowl, mix together the asparagus, spring onion and peas. Stir in the mint leaves and parmesan until well combined.


Tip the beaten eggs into the bowl and mix carefully. Season with freshly ground black pepper and mix again.


Spoon the frittata mixture into the prepared ovenproof dish. Place the dish onto a baking tray, then transfer to the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the eggs have completely set and a skewer inserted into the centre of the frittata comes out clean.


Serve with cherry tomatoes.
