Method


Pre-heat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the cheese sauce, melt the butter in a large pan, add the flour and cook for 2-3 minutes.


Gradually add the milk, whisking all the time until the milk is completely incorporated and the sauce is thickened.


Once you have a smooth sauce add the mustard, Worcestershire sauce and grated cheese.


For the bake, melt 25g/1oz of the butter in a medium frying pan, then add the chopped leeks. Cook for 2-3 minutes until softened then add to the cheese sauce.


Melt the rest of the butter in a clean frying pan and gently fry the brioche cubes.


In a large pan of boiling water cook the broccoli and cauliflower for 2-3 minutes and drain.


Take an ovenproof dish and lay the broccoli, cauliflower, sauce and brioche, finish with a layer of the Linconshire poacher cheese and brioche. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes.


For the dressing, pour the oil and vinegar in a small glass bowl and whisk in the mustard and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper.


To serve, place the baby gem leaves in a bowl, pour the dressing over and mix to combine.


Spoon the bake onto a serving plate and serve the broccoli alongside and the salad in a small bowl.
