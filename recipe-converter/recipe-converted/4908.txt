Ingredients
For the herby noodle tortilla

4 free-range eggs
salt and freshly ground black pepper
small handful each fresh basil, fresh coriander, fresh parsley, chopped
150g/5½oz fresh egg noodles
25g/1oz butter
dash olive oil

For the chilli peanut dressing

dash olive oil
¼ onion, sliced
1 garlic clove, peeled and chopped
½ fresh red chilli, finely sliced
1 tsp white wine vinegar
3 tbsp soy sauce
2 tbsp edamame beans
1 tbsp chopped cashews




Method


For the tortilla, crack the eggs into a bowl, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and beat well. Stir in the herbs and egg noodles.


Heat the butter and oil in a medium frying pan, add the egg and noodle mixture and cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until just set. Slide onto a plate and leave to cool slightly before slicing.


For the dressing, heat the oil in a small saucepan, add the onion and sauté for 3-4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for a further 1-2 minutes. Add the rest of the ingredients and warm through for 1-2 minutes.


To serve, place slices of the tortilla onto a serving plate and drizzle over the dressing.
