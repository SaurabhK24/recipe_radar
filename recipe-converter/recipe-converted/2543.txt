A no-bake cake that's perfect for making with children. You can also pick and mix the fillings to suit your taste.






By Annabel Karmel






Ingredients

250g/8oz digestive biscuits
150g/5oz milk chocolate
150g/5oz dark chocolate
100g/3½oz unsalted butter
150g/5oz golden syrup
100g/3½oz dried apricots, chopped
75g/2½oz raisins
60g/2oz pecans, chopped (optional)




Method


Use cling film to line a 20cm (8in) shallow, square-shaped tin. Leave extra cling film hanging over the sides.


Bash the biscuits into pieces using a rolling pin. (Put them in a plastic bag first so they don't go everywhere!)


Melt chocolate, butter and golden syrup in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Stir occasionally.


Remove the bowl from the heat and stir in the broken biscuits, apricots, raisins and pecans (optional).


Spoon the mixture into the tin. Level the surface by pressing it down with a potato masher.


Leave to cool, then put the chocolate mixture in the fridge for 1-2 hours to set.


Turn out the cake and peel off the cling film. Cut the cake into 12 squares and enjoy!




Recipe Tips
Marshmallows, honeycomb and meringues all work well as alternative fillings - just chop them into small chunks and mix in with the melted chocolate mixture.
