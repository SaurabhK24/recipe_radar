Ingredients

1 small sprig fresh thyme
4 cloves of garlic, unpeeled and lightly crushed
1 large guinea fowl, weighing about 1.5 kg/3lb 5oz
salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 tbsp light olive oil

For the sauce

100ml/3fl oz Madeira or port
250ml/9fl oz brown chicken or beef stock
2 tbsp butter
½ tsp fresh thyme leaves
½ tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper

To serve

25g/1oz butter
250g/9oz wild mushrooms, such as chanterelles, shiitake
salt
1 savoy cabbage
pinch of nutmeg




Method


Pre-heat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Place the thyme and garlic inside the guinea fowl and season inside and out.


Heat two tablespoons of the oil in a roasting tin in the oven. Place the guinea fowl on its side in the tin and roast for 10 minutes.


Turn the guinea fowl on to its other side and continue to roast for another 10 minutes. Turn the guinea fowl breast-side up, lower the oven temperature to 180C/350F/Gas 4, and roast for 20 minutes.


Remove the guinea fowl from the oven, transfer to a clean dish, cover with foil and allow to rest for 15 minutes. To make the sauce, pour the fat from the roasting pan and deglaze the pan with Madeira or port. Tip the juices into a saucepan and add the stock. Boil until reduced by half.


Heat a large frying pan over a high heat, add the remaining oil and fry the mushrooms with a little salt for 3-4 minutes. Tip onto a roasting tray.


Cut the legs off the guinea fowl and place on the roasting tray with the mushrooms. Cut down the side of the breastbone and remove the breasts. Place on the roasting tray.


To serve, warm the mushrooms and guinea fowl in the oven for 3-4 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the sauce to the boil, then whisk in the butter and herbs. Season to taste.


Heat a frying pan until hot. Add butter and the cabbage. Stir fry until wilted season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.


Place a little cabbage and some mushrooms on each warmed plate. Top with the guinea fowl and pour over the sauce.
