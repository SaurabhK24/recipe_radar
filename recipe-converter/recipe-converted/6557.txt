Ingredients

1 orange, peel only, white pith removed
1 lemon, peel only, white pith removed
1 tbsp grated ginger
1 cinnamon stick
2 cloves
100ml/3½fl oz vanilla vodka
6 cardamom pods
200ml/7fl oz port
750ml/1pint 7fl oz red wine
150g/5¼oz sugar
25g/1 oz sheet gelatine, softened in cold water, drained
12 tbsp frozen summer fruits, defrosted
400g/14 oz fresh custard
550ml/1 pint double cream, whipped until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed
1 tsp vanilla extract
handful flaked almonds, toasted, to decorate




Method


Heat the orange and lemon zest, ginger, cinnamon stick, cloves, vanilla vodka, cardamom pods, port, red wine and sugar over a low heat until hot, but not boiling. Strain the mixture through a sieve onto the softened gelatine in a large bowl and stir well.


Spoon the soft fruit into a large glass serving bowl and pour enough of the jelly mixture to fill it a third of the way up. Chill in the fridge overnight, or until they have completely set.


Mix half of the whipped cream with the custard and vanilla in a bowl until well combined and spoon this mixture onto the set jelly.


To serve, spoon the remaining whipped cream onto the trifle and scatter over the flaked almonds.
