Ingredients

100g/3½oz basmati rice
150ml/5fl oz double cream
150ml/5fl oz milk
1 tbsp cocoa powder
85g/3oz soft brown sugar
1 tsp clear honey
200g/7oz can pineapple rings, drained




Method


Place the rice, double cream, milk, cocoa powder, 55g/2oz of the sugar and honey into a saucepan. Slowly bring up to the boil, stirring constantly, then reduce the heat and simmer for 12 minutes until the rice is cooked.


Carefully melt the remaining sugar in a small frying pan over a low heat. Add the pineapple rings and fry until caramelised and golden-brown.


To serve, pack half of the rice into a coffee cup and then turn upside down onto a plate. Remove the cup, and repeat on another serving plate. Arrange the pineapple rings on top of the rice and serve.
