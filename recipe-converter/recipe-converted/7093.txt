Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the John Dory fillets, heat the butter in a large frying pan until bubbling. Add the fish and fry for five minutes on each side, or until lightly golden and cooked through. Set aside and keep warm.


For the sauce, heat the butter in a pan, add the shallot and gently fry for 1-2 minutes.


Add the white wine and simmer until the volume is reduced by half.


Add the cream and lemon juice and zest and simmer for 2-3 minutes to warm through. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


For the pilaf, boil the rice according to the packet instructions, drain well and place into a bowl.


Add the shallot, wine and cream to the rice and stir to combine. Spoon into a small ovenproof dish and bake in the oven for five minutes.


To serve, divide the pilaf rice between two serving plates, top with a fillet of fish and pour over the sauce. Garnish with chopped chives and lemon slices.
