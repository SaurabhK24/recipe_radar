Ingredients

30g/1oz unsalted butter, for greasing
110g/4oz self-raising flour
110g/4oz caster sugar
110g/4oz unsalted butter
2 eggs
½ sweet potato, diced and boiled until soft
2.5cm/1 inch piece of ginger, peeled and finely chopped

For the ginger syrup

110g/4oz caster sugar
5cm/2 inch piece of ginger, peeled and finely chopped
1 orange, peeled and segmented, to serve




Method


Grease a small pudding basin with butter.


Place the flour, sugar, butter, eggs and sweet potato into a food processor. Blitz together until smooth and combined.


Pour the mixture into the bowl and cover with cling film.


Place in the microwave and cook on HIGH for four minutes.


To make the ginger syrup, gently heat the sugar in a heavy-based pan and cook over a low heat until dissolved and a caramel has formed. Add the chopped ginger, shaking the pan until it is well coated in the caramel.


Turn out the sponge pudding onto a serving dish and drizzle the ginger syrup over.


Garnish with the segmented orange and serve.
