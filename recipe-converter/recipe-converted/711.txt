Ingredients
For the stuffing meatballs

100g/3½oz turkey slices
100g/3½oz left-over stuffing
1 free-range egg, beaten
1 tbsp plain flour
1 tbsp olive oil

For the curry sauce

25g/1oz unsalted butter
1 tbsp olive oil
½ onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
1 tsp curry powder
50ml/2fl oz double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper
coriander leaves, to garnish




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the stuffing meatballs, place the turkey slices, stuffing, egg and flour into the bowl of a food processor and blend to combine.


Shape the mixture into five equal-sized balls with floured hands.


Heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan. Add the meatballs to the pan and cook until coloured all over.


Transfer the meatballs to the oven and bake for five minutes, or until cooked through.


To make the curry sauce, melt the butter with the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat.


Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened, but not coloured.


Add the curry powder and stir for another minute, or until the onions are completely coated.


Add the double cream and stir until thick. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, place the meatballs in a serving bowl, spoon the sauce over and garnish with the coriander leaves.
