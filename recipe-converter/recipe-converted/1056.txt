500g/1lb 2oz ready-made sweet pastry

125g/4½oz fresh breadcrumbs

1 lemon, zest and juice

Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the pastry case, lightly grease a 25cm/10in loose-bottomed tart tin.


On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry and use to line the tart tin.


Cover the pastry with cling film and place into the fridge to rest for 15 minutes.


Remove the pastry from the fridge and remove the cling film. Line the pastry case with greaseproof paper and fill with baking beans.


Transfer to the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes.


Remove the pastry case from the oven and remove the greaseproof paper and baking beans. Return to the oven for a further 3-5 minutes.


Remove the pastry case from the oven and lower the oven temperature to 140C/275F/Gas 1.


For the filling, place the golden syrup, breadcrumbs, beaten eggs and lemon juice and zest into a bowl and mix well.


Pour the filling mixture into the tart case, transfer to the oven and bake for 50 minutes-1 hour, or until golden-brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly.


To serve, place slices of the tart onto serving plates with a dollop of whipped cream and fresh mint, to garnish.
