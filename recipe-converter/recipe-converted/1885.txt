4-5 tbsp milk
30g/1oz Stilton, finely crumbled
1 apple, core, sliced into rounds

Whisk together the flour, egg and milk in a bowl to form a smooth batter. Add the Stilton and mix well.


Heat 1cm/½in depth of vegetable oil in a deep frying pan. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)
