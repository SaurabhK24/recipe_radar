Ingredients

4 large skinless boneless chicken breasts, weighing about 200g/7oz each
1 tsp chilli powder
1 tsp sweet paprika
2 tsp cracked black peppercorn
1 tsp garlic salt
1 tsp chopped thyme
1 tsp chopped parsley
1 tsp olive oil

For the Pinto and Avocado Salsa

1 tin pinto beans, drained (preferably organic)
1 small red onion, finely chopped
1-2 large red chillies, sliced
2 avocados, peeled, stoned and diced
4 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
2 tbsp lemon juice
6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
salt
freshly ground black pepper




Method


Remove the chicken from the fridge and allow about one hour to come to room temperature.


Mix together the spices, seasoning, herbs and half the olive oil. Rub the mixture into the chicken.


Grill over hot coals or on a preheated, ridged, stovetop grill pan, for about eight minutes on each side, basting with the remaining oil.


To make the salsa, gently stir together all the ingredients in a large bowl and allow to stand for ten minutes before serving.
