Ingredients

150g/5oz brioche crumbs (you can make your own by blending a brioche in a food processor)
100g/3Â½oz desiccated coconut, toasted in a dry frying pan
1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
1 tbsp softened butter
1 red chilli, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, crushed to a paste with a pinch of salt
salt and freshly ground black pepper
12 green lip mussels, ready-cooked, bottom half of the shell on

For the salsa

1 pink grapefruit, peeled, segmented
1 lime, juice only
1 red chilli, finely chopped
12 lychees from a can, drained, chopped
splash Tabasco sauce




Method


Preheat the grill to its highest setting.


Place the brioche breadcrumbs, toasted coconut, coriander, butter, chilli, garlic and salt and freshly ground black pepper into a bowl and mix together well.


Place the mussels, open-side up, onto a baking tray. Place a spoonful of the breadcrumb mixture into each mussel to cover the mussel flesh completely. Place under the grill and cook for 5-6 minutes, or until the topping is golden-brown.


For the salsa, place the grapefruit segments, lime juice, chilli, chopped lychees and Tabasco into a bowl and mix well.


To serve, place three mussels onto each plate and serve a dollop of salsa alongside.
