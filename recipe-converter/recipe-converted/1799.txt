Ingredients
For the salmon

100g/3½oz salmon fillet, skin removed
dash olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the creamed garlic peas

100g/3½oz fresh peas
15g/½oz butter
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
3 tbsp double cream
1 sprig fresh thyme, leaves only
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the balsamic reduction

3 tbsp balsamic vinegar




Method


For the salmon, rub the salmon with olive oil, salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a griddle pan until hot, add the salmon and griddle for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until charred on the outside and just cooked through.


For the creamed garlic peas, place the peas into a pan of boiling salted water and boil for 2-3 minutes, or until tender and then drain. Place the cooked peas into a small pan, add the butter and garlic and fry gently for 1-2 minutes. Add the cream, thyme, salt and freshly ground black pepper and simmer for two minutes.


For the balsamic reduction, pour the balsamic vinegar into a small pan and simmer for ten minutes, or until reduced and sticky.


To serve, spoon the peas onto a serving plate. Top with the chargrilled salmon and drizzle the balsamic reduction onto the plate.
