Ingredients
For the griddled pepper

1 yellow pepper, de-seeded, cut into quarters
olive oil, for drizzling
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the rocket and sesame salad

1 large handful rocket leaves
2 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted
squeeze lemon juice
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the skordalia

2 slices white bread, crusts removed
3 tbsp cold water
1 clove garlic, chopped
2-3 tbsp olive oil
½ lemon, juice only
2 tsp white wine vinegar
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the griddled pepper, drizzle the pepper quarters with olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a griddle pan until smoking, add the peppers and griddle for 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown and slightly charred.


For the rocket salad, mix all of the salad ingredients together in a large bowl.


For the skordalia, place the bread in a bowl with the water and leave to soak for a few minutes. Squeeze out the excess water, then place the softened bread into a food processor with the rest of the skordalia ingredients and blend to a smooth paste.


To serve, spoon the skordalia onto two serving plates, top with the griddled pepper and serve the rocket salad on the sides.
