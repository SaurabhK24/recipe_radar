The perfect meringue is sweet, light and crisp with a slightly chewy centre. Try sandwiching them with strawberries and cream.

Ingredients
For the meringue

8 free-range eggs, whites only
200g/7oz white caster sugar

For the filling

400ml/14fl oz double cream
2 tbsp icing sugar
250g/9oz strawberries, hulled and quartered




Method


For the meringue, preheat the oven to 100C/200F/Gas ¾. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. You may want to draw circles on the paper to help keep your meringues the same size.


Place the egg whites into a clean glass or metal bowl and whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed.


Gradually add the sugar and continue to whisk until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed.


Spoon into a piping bag fitted with a large plain or star nozzle.


Pipe into 16 small rounds onto the prepared baking tray.


Place in the oven and bake for 20 minutes.


Turn the oven off but leave the meringues in the oven for at least two hours.


When crisp, remove from the oven


For the filling, whisk the cream and icing sugar together until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Fold in half the strawberries.


Place a meringue onto a serving plate. Spread the whipped cream lightly over the meringue to cover totally, and top with more strawberries. Place another meringue on top of the strawberries.
