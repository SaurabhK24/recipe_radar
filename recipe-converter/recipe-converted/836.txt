Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.


Put the oil for the vegetables in a large plastic bag with the garlic, saffron and some salt and pepper. Add the vegetables, grip the top edge of the bag to seal and toss together. Set aside for at least 30 minutes.


Meanwhile for the rouille, put the tomatoes and pepper in a small roasting tin. Sprinkle with the garlic, smoked paprika some salt and pepper. Then drizzle the oil over and roast for 15 minutes. Allow to cool.


Peel the skins from the tomatoes and pepper. Purée the flesh in a liquidizer or food processor with any juices from the roasting tin until smooth. Spoon into a serving bowl and set aside, keep warm.


Tip the saffron vegetables into a large roasting tin and cook in the oven for 15-20 minutes, turning once, until browned.
