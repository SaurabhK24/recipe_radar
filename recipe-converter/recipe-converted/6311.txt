Ingredients
For the chicken

100ml/3½fl oz tequila
3 limes, juice only
1 red chilli, chopped
1 x 330ml/12fl oz bottle Mexican beer
1 garlic clove, chopped
8 chicken legs
flour, seasoned with salt and freshly ground black pepper
vegetable oil, to deep fry

For the guacamole

2 ripe avocados, chopped
2 plum tomatoes, peeled, seeds removed, chopped
1 bird's eye chilli, seeds removed, chopped
1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander stems
½ tsp chilli powder
1 lime, juice only

For the pico de gallo

1 red onion, finely chopped
1 red chilli, finely chopped
2 limes, juice only
2 tomatoes, chopped




Method


For the chicken; mix the tequila, lime, chilli, beer and garlic together in a large bowl.


Score the chicken legs with a sharp knife and place into the marinade. Mix well to coat the chicken in the marinade, then transfer to the fridge to marinate for two hours.


Heat the oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (Caution: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Remove the chicken from the marinade and pat dry.


Dredge the chicken legs in the seasoned flour, then carefully place into the hot oil and deep-fry for 15 minutes, or until golden-brown and completely cooked through.


Carefully remove the chicken legs from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


For the guacamole, place all of the guacamole ingredients into a clean bowl and mix together well.


For the pico de gallo, place all of the pico de gallo ingredients into a clean bowl and mix together well.


To serve, place the chicken legs into a big bowl with the bowls of guacamole and pico de gallo alongside.
