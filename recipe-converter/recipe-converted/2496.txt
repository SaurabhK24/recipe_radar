This steak recipe works as a quick and easy midweek supper or a dinner party main. If you'd rather not use an aged sirloin steak, one that hasn't been aged will work well, too.

Ingredients

4 x 300g/10½oz aged sirloin steaks
4 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the Thai salad

¼ red cabbage, thinly sliced
1 small red onion, thinly sliced
1 Asian pear, peeled and finely chopped
½ coconut, ¼ shaved, ¼ grated
2 tbsp fresh coriander leaves
2 tbsp fresh mint leaves
4 tbsp sesame seeds

For the dressing

2 limes, juice only
4 garlic cloves, crushed
2 tbsp finely grated ginger
2 tbsp palm sugar
4 tbsp fish sauce
6 tbsp soy sauce
2 red chillies, 1 finely chopped, 1 sliced
2 tbsp chopped fresh mint leaves
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander leaves

To serve

2 tbsp toasted hazelnuts, roughly chopped
1 lime, halved




Method


Season the steaks with salt and pepper and rub the oil all over. Heat a griddle pan and cook the steaks to your liking. Remove from the heat, and leave to rest for around the same time you cooked it for.


To make the salad, put all the ingredients into a bowl and mix well.


Put all the ingredients for the dressing into a pestle and mortar and pound to a rough paste. Just before serving, add the dressing to the salad and mix well.


To serve, cut the steak into slices and lay on a serving dish. Add the salad over the slices of steak, and garnish with the chopped nuts and the lime on the side.
