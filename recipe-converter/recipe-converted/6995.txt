Ingredients
For the pancakes

110g/4oz plain flour
pinch salt
2 free-range eggs
275ml/9fl oz milk
50g/1¾oz butter

For the flambéed raspberries

1½ oranges, juice only
2 tbsp sugar
25g/1oz butter
1 tbsp white wine
50g/1¾oz raspberries
1 tbsp brandy




Method


For the pancakes, sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the middle of the flour, crack the eggs into the middle and gently whisk together. Gradually whisk in the milk until the batter is smooth and has the consistency of single cream.


Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat and when it is sizzling spoon a ladleful of the batter into the hot pan. Swirl the mixture around the pan and leave to cook for 2-3 minutes, then flip over and cook on the other side for another 2-3 minutes. Slide the finished pancake onto a warm plate and repeat five times with the rest of the mixture. Set pancakes aside to keep warm.


For the flambéed raspberries, place all of the ingredients except the brandy into a frying pan and cook over a medium heat for 2-3 minutes. Add the brandy and flambé for 30 seconds.


To serve, fold the pancakes in half, then in half again, pile onto a serving plate and pour over the flambéed raspberries.
