A suitably spooky cocktail perfect for a Halloween celebration. Black vodka and blackberries combine in this gothic punch.






By Wayne Collins






Ingredients

25ml/1fl oz black vodka
1 tbsp lemon juice
2 tsp vanilla extract
25ml/1fl oz blackberry liqueur
25ml/1fl oz fresh apple juice

To garnish

1 lychee, peeled
½ tsp strawberry jam
1 blueberry




Method


Place the vodka, lemon juice, vanilla syrup, blackberry liqueur and apple juice into a cocktail shaker filled with ice and shake well. Pour into a cocktail glass.


To garnish, cut a small hole into the lychee. Fill with strawberry jam, then stick the blueberry into the jam to create an 'eyeball'. Float the 'eyeball' in the cocktail and serve.
