Ingredients
For the dressing

20ml/¾fl oz Cabernet Sauvignon vinegar
20g/¾oz Dijon mustard
80ml/2¾fl oz olive oil
salt and pepper
1 lemon, juice and zest

For the sardines, lettuce and samphire

3 Little Gem lettuce
1 tbsp olive oil
60g/2¼oz samphire, picked
8 large sardines, scaled and gutted
coarse sea salt
1 tbsp finely chopped parsley




Method


Heat a grill pan or wire rack over the heat or coals of a barbecue.


For the dressing, whisk the vinegar, mustard and olive oil together in a bowl until fully emulsified. Season with salt and pepper, adding a little lemon juice if desired.


For the sardines, lettuce and samphire, trim the brown root off the bottom of the lettuce and then cut into quarters. Brush with a little olive oil and place on the grill until charred and toasted.


Blanch the samphire in a pan of boiling water for twenty seconds, then remove from the water with a slotted spoon.


Brush the sardines with a little oil and season with the sea salt.


Put the sardines onto the hot grill or barbecue and cook until the skin is charred; then turn over to cook the other side of the fish.


When cooked flake the fish into a bowl with the gem lettuce, parsley and and lemon zest. Add the samphire and dress with the red wine dressing.
