Ingredients
For the sweet potato chips

300ml/½ pint vegetable oil, for deep frying
1 large sweet potato, peeled, cut into small pieces
salt, for sprinkling

For the herb and cobnut pesto

30g/1oz cobnuts, shelled
2 tbsp olive oil
large handful each fresh basil, parsley and chives
25g/1oz fresh breadcrumbs
salt and freshly ground black pepper
squeeze lemon juice
1 garlic clove, chopped




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Carefully place the chips into the hot oil and cook for 6-7 minutes. Remove the chips from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


Place the chips onto a baking sheet and transfer to the oven to roast for 8-10 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Remove the chips from the oven, sprinkle with salt and set aside to keep warm.


For the pesto, place all of the ingredients into a small food processor and blend until smooth.


To serve, place the chips into a bowl and pour over the pesto.
