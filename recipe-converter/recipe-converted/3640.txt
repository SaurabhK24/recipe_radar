This quick recipe is a lifesaver for midweek suppers. The dry dukkah spice mix is also great as a dip for flatbreads.

Ingredients
For the quinoa salad

200g/7oz quinoa, cooked according to the packet instructions
handful fresh parsley, chopped
1 tbsp chopped fresh mint
1 red pepper, finely diced
1 cucumber, finely diced
1 red onion, finely diced
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 lemon, juice only
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the dukkah

½ tsp cloves
1 tsp fennel seeds
1 tsp coriander seeds
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp paprika
pinch turmeric
½ tsp chilli flakes
50g/2oz hazelnuts, chopped
30g/1oz pistachios, chopped
1 tbsp sesame seeds
4 tbsp honey
1 orange, juice only
salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 tbsp olive oil


12 lamb cutlets




Method


For the quinoa salad, mix together the quinoa, herbs and vegetables in a bowl and dress with olive oil and lemon juice. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


For the dukkah, heat a frying pan and dry fry the cloves, fennel, coriander and cumin until fragrant. Place in a pestle and mortar and grind until smooth.


Combine the spices with the rest of the dukkah ingredients in a bowl and mix until well combined.


Rub each lamb cutlet with the dukkah and orange juice mixture and grill on a hot griddle, on a barbecue, or under a pre-heated grill, for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking.


To serve place some of the quinoa salad onto four plates and place three lamb cutlets on top of each.
