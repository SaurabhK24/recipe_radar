A quick, easy meal for two. Miss out the ham for a tasty meat-free option.

Ingredients

3 tbsp olive oil
1 onion, finely sliced
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 green peppers, finely sliced
110g/4oz roasted peppers, from a jar, thinly sliced (optional)
2 tomatoes, roughly chopped
4 free-range eggs, beaten
4 slices ham, bacon or prosciutto
2 slices crusty bread, toasted
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Heat a frying pan until smoking, then add the olive oil followed by the onions, garlic and green peppers. Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the onions are beginning to soften.


Stir in the roasted peppers (if using) and tomatoes, and cook for 1-2 minutes, then season with salt and pepper.


Pour in the eggs and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring to scramble the eggs, until the eggs are just set.


In a clean frying pan, fry the ham for one minute on both sides, or until golden-brown all over.


Serve the eggs on top of crusty bread, topped with the fried ham.
