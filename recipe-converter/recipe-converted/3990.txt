Method


For the mushroom ketchup, heat a frying pan and add the butter. Once melted, fry the shallots for a few minutes. Add the blended mushrooms and fry until soft.


Add the sugar and vinegar and cook until the volume of liquid has reduced then add cream and reduce again. Blend in a food processor with the anchovies then pass through a sieve. Keep in the fridge until needed.


For the flash fried steak, in a large very hot frying pan, add a little oil. Once hot, season the steaks with the salt and black pepper.


Add a knob of butter to the pan and then add the steak. Cook for 30-40 seconds one side and then 20 seconds on the other side.


Let the steaks rest for two minutes and then slice.
