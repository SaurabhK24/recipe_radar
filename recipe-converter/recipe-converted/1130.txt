Ingredients

500g/1lb 2oz strong flour
15g/½oz salt
55ml/2fl oz olive oil
20g/¾oz fresh yeast
275ml/9fl oz water




Method


Mix all the ingredients in a large bowl taking care not to put yeast on the top of the salt.


Knead well with your hands and knuckles until the dough is elastic, smooth and shiny. Cover with a piece of cling film and leave to rise for 1 hour.


Line a baking tin with baking parchment and mould the dough into a sausage and place in the tin.


Preheat your oven to 220C/450F/Gas 6, then leave the dough to rise for a further 30 minutes to 1 hour. Place the tin in the oven for 35 minutes. Remove from the tin, tap the bottom with your knuckles - if it sounds hollow, it's ready. Cool on a wire rack.
