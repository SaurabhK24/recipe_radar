Ingredients

50g/1¾oz butter, plus extra for greasing
175g/6oz fillet haddock
10 mushrooms, sliced
75ml/2½fl oz white wine
100ml/3½fl oz hot vegetable stock
1 tbsp chopped fresh dill
½ lemon, juice only
50ml/2fl oz double cream




Method


Preheat oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Butter a small ovenproof dish and place the haddock fillet into it.


Cover the top of the fish with the sliced mushrooms, then pour over the wine and hot vegetable stock. Transfer the dish to the oven and cook for eight minutes, or until cooked through.


Remove the dish from the oven and pour the juices from the cooked fish into a saucepan, then loosely cover the fish with aluminium foil to keep warm.


Bring the juices to the boil in the saucepan and cook over a high heat for two minutes, or until slightly reduced. Reduce the heat slightly, then add the 50g/1¾oz butter, dill and lemon juice to the pan and simmer for one minute. Add the cream and cook for another minute.


To serve, place the haddock onto a serving plate and pour over the sauce.
