Ingredients

570ml/1 pint malt vinegar
450g/1lb soft brown sugar
300g/11oz sultanas
2kg/4lb 4oz ripe red tomatoes, cut into 6 or 8 pieces
500g/1lb 2oz green apples, peeled and chopped
400g/14oz shallots, peeled and roughly chopped
4 red chillies, chopped
1 tbsp root ginger, finely chopped
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Place the vinegar and sugar in a large saucepan and bring to the boil. Cook for three to four minutes until the sugar has melted.


Add the sultanas and cook until just reduced.


Add all the other ingredients, bring to the boil and cook for about 20 to 30 minutes, stirring frequently.


Leave the chutney with a chunky texture and not too cooked as that will cause it to be a purée.


Cool the chutney, place into sterilised jars and store for two to three weeks in the fridge.
