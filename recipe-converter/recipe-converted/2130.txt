From Saturday Kitchen






Ingredients

2 tbsp olive oil
1 chicken breast
Â½ lemon, juice only
5 tbsp white wine
knob of butter
pinch of flour
salt and freshly ground black pepper

To serve

green beans




Method


Heat a large frying pan and add the olive oil, fry the chicken for 5 minutes on each side, or until cooked through.


Add the lemon juice and salt and pepper. Add the white wine and reduce for 30 seconds. Coat the knob of butter in flour, and drop in the mixture to thicken.


Bring a pan of water to the boil and cook the green beans for 3-4 minutes, drain.


Put the beans on a plate, top with the chicken, drizzle over the sauce and serve.




Recipe Tips
If you want to speed up the cooking time you can flatten the chicken breast with a meat mallet or rolling pin between two sheets of cling film.
