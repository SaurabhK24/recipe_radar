Ingredients
For the soufflés

1 passion fruit, halved
50ml/2fl oz white wine
2 tbsp sugar
1 tsp cornflour
1 tsp cold water
2 free-range eggs, whites only

For the sauce

1 passion fruit, halved
1 orange, juice only
1 tbsp icing sugar
1 tsp cornflour
1 tsp cold water

For the lime cream

100ml/3½fl oz double cream
1 tbsp Greek-style yoghurt
1 lime, zest only




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the soufflés, scoop out the flesh from the passion fruit and place into a saucepan. Reserve the shells.


Add the white wine and sugar to the pan, and warm through over a low heat. In a small bowl, mix together the cornflour and water and pour into the passion fruit mixture, stirring until the liquid starts to thicken. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.


For the sauce, scoop out the flesh from the passion fruit halves and place into another saucepan over a medium heat, reserving the shells. Stir in the orange juice and icing sugar. Mix the cornflour and cold water together to make a smooth paste, then add to the pan. Reduce the liquid over a high heat until thickened.


For the lime cream, whisk the cream until thickened and fold in the yoghurt and lime zest. Set aside.


For the soufflés In a large bowl, whisk the egg whites together until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl. Gently fold in the passion fruit mixture, then divide the mixture equally among the four passion fruit shell halves. Place on a baking tray and bake in the oven for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown and risen.


To serve, carefully transfer the passion fruit soufflés onto a plate and drizzle around the sauce. Add a spoon of lime cream on the side, dust with icing sugar and serve immediately.
