Ingredients
For the salad

1 pear, cut into quarters, cored and skin left on
4 thin slices ciabatta brushed with olive oil
100g/3½oz baby leaf spinach
small bunch fresh coriander, roughly chopped
2 slices toast, cut into thick croutons and tossed in olive oil
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the chutney

1 tbsp olive oil
¼ onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, finely sliced
50g/1¾oz brown sugar
150g/5½oz cherry tomatoes, halved
3 tbsp white wine vinegar




Method


Heat a griddle pan until smoking. Add the pear quarters and griddle on both sides for one minute to create grill lines, then remove from the heat and set aside.


Place the ciabatta bread onto the griddle pan and cook for one minute on each side to create grill lines. Remove and set aside.


To make the salad, take two of the griddled pear quarters and chop them into small dice.


Place the spinach, coriander, croutons and diced pear in a large bowl and mix together well.


Add the olive oil, season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and set aside.


To make the chutney, place the olive oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and fry for one minute.


Add the brown sugar and cherry tomatoes and cook for a further minute.


Add the white wine vinegar and heat to simmer and cook to reduce for five minutes.


To serve, place the salad on a plate with the remaining chargrilled pear pieces and ciabatta placed around the salad. Pour the chutney into a small bowl and serve beside the salad.
