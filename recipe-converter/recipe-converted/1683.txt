Ingredients
For the cashew bread and honey pudding

200ml/7fl oz double cream
3 free-range eggs, beaten
2 tbsp honey
½ tsp mixed spice powder
2 slices white bread
butter, for greasing
2 tsp caster sugar
25g/1oz cashew nuts, roughly chopped

For the cashew brittle

85g/3oz caster sugar
85g/3oz cashew nuts




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the cashew bread and honey pudding, beat the cream, eggs, honey and mixed spice together in a bowl until completely combined.


Dip the bread slices into the batter mixture. Press a slice of bread into a greased ramekin dish. Repeat with the other slice of bread in a second ramekin, then pour equal amounts of the remaining egg mixture into each ramekin.


Sprinkle over the caster sugar and chopped cashew nuts. Place the ramekins onto a baking tray and transfer to the oven to cook for 6-8 minutes, or until golden-brown and slightly risen.


For the cashew brittle, place the sugar and nuts into a frying pan and place over a medium heat. Cook until the sugar has melted and turned golden-brown.


Pour the cashew caramel onto a silicone sheet and leave to cool and set. Break up into shards.


To serve, place each pudding in its ramekin onto a plate. Dust with icing sugar and garnish with pieces of the cashew brittle.
