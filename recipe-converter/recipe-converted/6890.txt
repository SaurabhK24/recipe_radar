Ingredients

4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
4 tbsp clear honey
2 tbsp rice vinegar
2 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp sesame oil
1 garlic cloves, crushed
2.5cm/1in piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated
2 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted
small bunch of fresh coriander, roughly chopped
1 large carrot, cut into fine matchsticks
1 bunch of spring onions, shredded
½ cucumber, peeled, halved, de-seeded and cut into matchsticks
½ Chinese lettuce, finely shredded




Method


Cut the chicken into thin strips and mix with the honey, vinegar and soy sauce. Leave to marinate in a non-metallic bowl for about 30 minutes.


Heat the sesame oil in a frying pan and cook the chicken over a high heat with any marinade for about 5 minutes until the chicken is cooked through, leaving some cooked marinade in the pan to use as the salad dressing.


To serve warm, toss in a large bowl with the remaining ingredients and eat immediately. To serve cold, leave the cooked chicken and marinade to cool and then toss with the remaining ingredients.
