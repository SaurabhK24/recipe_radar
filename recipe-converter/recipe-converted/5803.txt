Ingredients

110g/4oz butter, plus extra for greasing
55g/2oz polenta
55g/2oz self-raising flour
110g/4oz caster sugar
2 free-range eggs
1 lemon, zest only

For the lemon icing

100g/3½oz icing sugar
½ lemon, juice only
1 tsp clear honey, to serve
sprig fresh mint, to garnish




Method


Grease a small microwave-safe bowl with butter.


Place the butter, polenta, flour, sugar, eggs and lemon zest into a food processor and blend until smooth. Pour the cake mixture into the greased bowl and cover with cling film.


Place into the microwave and cook on the highest power for 5-8 minutes, until cooked through. You can test this by piercing the cake with a skewer and removing it - if the skewer comes away clean then the cake is ready.


For the lemon icing, sift the icing sugar into a bowl, add the lemon juice and mix well.


To serve, tip the pudding and bowl upside-down onto a plate and remove the bowl. Drizzle over the lemon icing and honey and garnish with fresh mint.
