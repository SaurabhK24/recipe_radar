Ingredients
For the crushed potato

100g/3½oz new potatoes, boiled until just cooked through
1 tbsp olive oil
25g/1oz unsalted butter
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the fennel sauce

50g/1¾oz unsalted butter
¼ fennel bulb, finely sliced
2 tbsp white wine
1 tsp white wine vinegar
50ml/2fl oz double cream
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives

For the sea bass

1 tbsp olive oil
100g/3½oz sea bass fillet
½ lemon, juice only
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


To make the crushed potato, roughly mash the potato in a bowl with the olive oil and butter, then season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To make the fennel sauce, heat the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the fennel and sauté until soft and golden.


Add the white wine and vinegar and cook until reduced in volume by half.


Add the cream and continue to reduce until thickened.


Add the chives, stir well and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To make the sea bass, heat the olive oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Season the sea bass on both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper and add to the pan skin-side down. Cook for three minutes, then turn the fillet over and continue to cook for 2-3 more minutes, or until cooked through.


Squeeze over the lemon juice and remove from the heat.


To serve, place the crushed potatoes in the middle of a warm plate. Place the sea bass on top and spoon the fennel sauce around.
