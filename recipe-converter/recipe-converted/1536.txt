Ingredients

200ml/7fl oz double cream
6 new potatoes, thinly sliced on a mandoline
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
55g/2oz Cambozola cheese, chopped
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives, to garnish




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Bring the cream to the boil in a frying pan and then add the potatoes and garlic. Using a wooden spoon, separate the potato slices into one layer across the bottom of the pan, season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper and simmer for 4-5 minutes.


Transfer the potatoes to a gratin dish, scatter over the cheese and bake for 8-10 minutes, or until golden-brown and bubbling. Serve with the chopped chives scattered over the top.
