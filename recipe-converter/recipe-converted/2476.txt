Ingredients

55g/2oz caster sugar
55g/2oz self-raising flour
55g/2oz butter, softened
2 tbsp cocoa powder
1 free-range egg, beaten
1-2 tbsp milk
100g/3½ oz fresh blueberries
icing sugar, to dust
double cream, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


In a bowl, mix together the sugar, self-raising flour, softened butter and cocoa powder. Add the egg and enough milk to make a smooth thick mixture.


Grease and line a 20cm/8in baking tin and spoon in the chocolate mixture. Scatter the blueberries over the top and place in the oven. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until just cooked but still soft in the middle. Cut the cake into squares.


Serve warm, dusted with icing sugar and drizzled with double cream.
