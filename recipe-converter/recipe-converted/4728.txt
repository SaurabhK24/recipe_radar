Ingredients
For the guacamole

2 tbsp olive oil
1 garlic clove, chopped
1 smoked chipotle chilli, chopped (available at some supermarkets and from online suppliers)
½ avocado, peeled and stone removed
1 lime, juice only
handful fresh coriander, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the tortillas

500ml/18fl oz vegetable oil, for deep frying
4 ready-made flour tortillas, cut into 8 wedges




Method


For the guacamole, place all of the guacamole ingredients into a food processor and blend until smooth.


For the tortillas, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Carefully place the tortilla wedges into the hot oil and deep fry until golden-brown and crisp. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


To serve, place the fried tortillas onto a serving plate with the guacamole in a small bowl alongside.
