Ingredients
For the parkin

110g/4oz self-raising flour
pinch salt
2 tbsp ground ginger
½ tsp ground nutmeg
½ tsp mixed spice
75g/2½oz oat flakes
175g/6oz golden syrup
50g/1¾oz black treacle
110g/4oz unsalted butter
110g/4oz soft brown sugar
1 free-range egg, beaten
2 tsp milk

For the cider and golden syrup sauce

200g/7oz golden syrup
50ml/2fl oz apple juice
1 tsp mixed spice
50ml/2fl oz cider
ice cream, to serve




Method


For the parkin, preheat the oven to 140C/275F/Gas 1 and butter a 20cm/8in square cake tin.


Sieve the flour, salt, ginger, nutmeg and mixed spice together into a large bowl. Mix in the oat flakes.


Put the syrup, treacle, butter and sugar into a small saucepan and melt over a gentle heat. Bring up to a simmer but do not boil. When the butter and sugar have melted, pour into the flour mixture and stir to combine.


Mix in the beaten egg and milk to create a soft, almost pouring consistency batter.


Pour into the buttered tin and bake for 50 minutes, or until firm in the centre.


Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin for 5-10 minutes before turning out and cutting into squares.


For the sauce, place all the ingredients in a saucepan, bring to the boil and simmer until a syrup consistency is formed.


Serve a square of parkin on each plate, then spoon over the syrup. Finish with a scoop of ice cream.
