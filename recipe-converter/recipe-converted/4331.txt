Ingredients

few drops of ginger pure essential oil
4 scallops, shelled and corals removed
1 tbsp groundnut oil
freshly ground black pepper




Method


Place a wire rack in the base of a large pot. Put the pot on the hob on a moderate heat. Add the drops of essential oil to the bottom of the pot. Sit the scallops on the rack, cover and leave to infuse for 2-5 minutes, depending on the strength of flavour you would like to achieve.


Meanwhile, preheat a frying pan until hot. Remove the scallops from the essential oil. Drizzle with the groundnut oil and season with black pepper. Fry for 30 seconds, on both sides, and serve.
