Ingredients
For the pancakes

170g/6oz plain flour
1 tbsp baking powder
110g/4oz caster sugar
2 free-range eggs
275ml/9½fl oz milk
knob of butter

To serve

2 punnets raspberries
150ml/5fl oz vanilla syrup
250ml/9fl oz vanilla ice cream




Method


To make the pancakes, sift the flour into a bowl with the baking powder. Add the sugar, then whisk in the eggs and the milk, until you have a smooth batter, but don't over-mix it.


Heat a non-stick pan, melt a little butter in it and cook the pancakes - you need about 3 spoonfuls for each one. Cook until golden brown and turn over to colour the other side. Remove and place on a large plate and keep warm.


Put the raspberries in a separate pan with the vanilla syrup and quickly but gently warm through. Pour the mixture over the pancakes and top with the vanilla ice cream.
