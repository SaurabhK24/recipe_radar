Ingredients

1 tbsp mild olive oil
2 garlic cloves, very thinly sliced
1 long red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped (or use ½ tsp dried chilli flakes)
150g/5½oz cherry tomatoes, halved
½ lemon, juice only
250g/9oz jumbo king prawns, cooked, peeled and deveined
3 heaped tbsp roughly chopped flat leaf parsley
ground black pepper
160g/6oz green beans, steamed, to serve




Method


Heat the oil in a small frying pan over a low heat. Add the garlic and chilli and cook very gently for five minutes or until the garlic is very soft but not coloured, stirring occasionally.


Add the tomatoes and lemon juice and cook for two minutes or until beginning to soften. Stir in the prawns and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring, until the tomatoes are well softened and the prawns are hot through.


Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the parsley, season with lots of pepper and serve with the beans.
