Ingredients

2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for frying the almonds
1 carrot, chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 turnip, chopped
2 garlic cloves, chopped
150g/5½oz baby button mushrooms, halved
250g/9oz green lentils
1.2 litres/2 pints vegetable stock
1 bay leaf
1 sprig rosemary
4 sprigs thyme
handful almonds
1 tbsp ground cinnamon
10 cherry tomatoes, quartered




Method


Heat the olive oil in a large pan and fry the carrot, celery, onion and turnip until softened – about five minutes.


Add the garlic and mushrooms. Fry for a further five minutes.


Add the lentils to the pan. Pour over the stock and add the herbs. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes.


Just before the end of the cooking time for the stew, in another pan, fry the almonds in a splash of olive oil with the cinnamon for two minutes.


Add the cherry tomatoes and warm through.


Serve the lentil stew with the almonds and tomatoes.
