A classic dish good at buffets and for large number of guests. Can be prepared in advance.



Ingredients

1 whole salmon, 3-4kg/6.5-10lb in weight, gutted and cleaned
4 sprigs fresh parsley
Â½ lemon, sliced
2 bay leaves
150ml/5fl oz dry white wine
2 tbsp vegetable oil




Method


Heat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.


Take 2 large sheets of foil and place on top of each other in a roasting tin. Spread the oil on the foil and place the salmon on top.


Put the parsley, lemon slices and bay leaves into the body cavity. Fold the edges of the foil together but just before sealing, pour in the wine.


Bake the fish for 50-60 minutes.


Serve hot or cold. If you want to serve it cold, allow the fish to cool in the parcel and then gently peel off the skin and garnish with thinly sliced cucumber and watercress.
