Ingredients

4 halibut chunks, weighing approx. 200g/7Â¼oz each
2 lemons, juice only
110g/4 oz butter
salt




Method


Score the fish with a sharp knife and marinate in the lemon juice for about 15 minutes.


Drain, reserving the lemon juice, and dry with kitchen towels.


Melt 75g/3oz butter in a large frying pan, making sure the heat is gentle and the butter doesn't burn.


Cook the fish in the butter for approximately 3-4 minutes on each side.


Increase the heat and pour in the lemon juice from the marinade; allow to bubble and evaporate slightly.


Add the remaining butter to thicken the sauce.


Serve immediately.
