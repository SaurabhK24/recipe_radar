A creamy fish curry with just enough spice, power it up with sweet potato and spinach to get you on your way to five a day.

From Ready Steady Cook






Ingredients
For the spice paste

1 green chilli, roughly chopped
pinch dried chilli flakes
2 tbsp vegetable oil
½ lemon, juice only
handful fresh coriander, plus extra for garnish

For the curry

1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 onion, sliced
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 large sweet potato, peeled and chopped
1 tsp curry powder
1 tsp cumin
150/5oz cod or pollack fillet, skinned and chopped (frozen is fine)
½ tin coconut milk
1 handful spinach leaves, or 2 blocks frozen spinach, defrosted and liquid squeezed out
½ lime, juice only
salt, to taste




Method


For the spice paste, place all of the spice paste ingredients into a food processor and blend until smooth. (You can use a pestle and mortar for this, too.)


For the curry, heat the vegetable oil in a wok and gently fry the onion and garlic for 4-5 minutes, or until softened. Add the sweet potato, curry powder and cumin and continue to fry for further 5-10 minutes, until the sweet potato has softened, then add the fish and two tablespoons of the spice paste. Stir to coat the fish in the spices, then add the coconut milk and bring to a gentle simmer.


Stir in the baby spinach leaves, lime juice and season with salt, to taste. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, then stir in the coriander.


Spoon the curry into a bowl and serve.
