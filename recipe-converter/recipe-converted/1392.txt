If a generous addition of bacon can't convert the sprout haters then nothing will. They're also super easy to make so the cook will be happy.

Ingredients

salt
900g/2lb 4oz Brussels sprouts, trimmed and loose leaves removed
2 tsp olive oil
225g/8oz pancetta, cut into cubes




Method


Bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil and add the sprouts. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until tender, then drain in a colander.


Heat a frying pan over a high heat until hot. Add the olive oil and pancetta cubes and fry for 5-7 minutes, or until the pancetta is crisp and golden-brown.


Add the drained sprouts and stir together to warm through. Serve immediately.
