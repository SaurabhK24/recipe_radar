These buns originate from Yorkshire and have been made since Elizabethan times. Serve them warm or cool with a dollop of extra thick double cream.

Ingredients
For the buns

150g/5½oz plain flour
150g/5½oz self-raising flour
1 tsp baking powder
150g/5½oz butter
150g/5½oz mixed dried fruit
100g/3½oz caster sugar
1 tsp cinnamon powder
½ tsp grated nutmeg
1 orange, zest only
1 lemon, zest only
1 free-range egg yolk
about 50ml/2fl oz milk

For the glaze

1 free-range egg, yolk only
pinch of salt
1 tbsp water
flaked almonds and glacé cherries, to decorate




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas6. Grease a baking tray.


Sieve the flours and baking powder into a large bowl and rub in the butter until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.


Add the mixed dried fruit, sugar, spices, orange and lemon zests.


Lightly beat the egg yolk and add it to the mixture with enough milk to make a stiff dough (you may not need all the milk). Divide the dough into 12, shape into mounds and place onto the baking tray.


For the glaze, mix the egg yolk, salt and water together and brush the mixture over each rascal. Decorate with the almonds and glacé cherries and bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.
