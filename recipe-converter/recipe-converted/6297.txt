Pillow soft and feather light, a meringue with fresh berries is the epitome of a summer dessert.






By Meera Syal


From A Taste of My Life






Ingredients

4 free-range egg whites
pinch salt
225g/8oz caster sugar
4 tsp cornflour
2 tsp raspberry vinegar
½ tsp vanilla extract

To serve

300ml/10½fl oz double cream
mixed summer fruits and berries, to taste




Method


Preheat the oven to 130C/275F/Gas 1.


Beat the egg whites and salt together in a bowl until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed.


Add the sugar one tablespoon at a time, whisking constantly, until all the sugar is incorporated and stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed.


Add the cornflour, raspberry vinegar and vanilla extract and whisk to combine.


Drop spoonfuls of the meringue mixture into little heaps onto a greased, baking parchment-lined baking sheet and transfer to the oven to bake for 1-1¼ hours, or until the outside of the meringues is crisp and the inside is marshmallow-like.


To serve, place one or two meringues into each dish and top with whipped cream and the summer berries of your choice.
