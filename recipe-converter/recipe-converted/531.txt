Fried chicken with spicy smoky kick - serve it in a basket with coleslaw for a touch of nostalgia.

Ingredients

9 chicken pieces of your choice (such as thighs, drumsticks or breast on the bone)
500ml/18fl oz buttermilk
100g/3½oz plain flour
50g/1¾oz cornflour
2 tsp ground dried oregano
2 tsp chilli powder
2 tsp ground dried sage
2 tsp dried basil
2 tsp dried marjoram
2 tsp ground white pepper
4 tsp table salt
2 tbsp sweet paprika
2 tbsp smoked paprika
2 tsp onion salt
2 tsp garlic powder
oil, for shallow frying
coleslaw, to serve




Method


Place the chicken pieces in a container, cover with the buttermilk and refrigerate for 12 hours.


Preheat the oven to 180C/375F/Gas 4.


Mix together the flours with the dried spices and herbs on a large plate. Remove the chicken from the buttermilk and shake off as much of the buttermilk as possible. Roll the chicken pieces around in the dry mix until coated.


Heat a large frying pan over a medium-low heat and add a glug of oil. Fry 2-3 pieces of chicken at a time (do not crowd the pan) until golden-brown all over and cooked through. When cooked, drain the chicken on kitchen paper and then transfer to a roasting tin.


Put the chicken pieces in the oven until the coating is crunchy rather than crisp (up to 15 minutes).


Serve in a basket with some coleslaw.
