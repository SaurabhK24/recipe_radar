Ingredients
For the corn skewers

1 corn-on-the-cob
1 tbsp water
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the chilli herb drizzle

3 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp white wine vinegar
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
¼ fresh red chilli, chopped
1 lime, juice only
1 lime, cut into wedges, for garnish




Method


For the corn skewers, place the corn-on-the-cob into a small bowl, sprinkle with water and microwave on high for six minutes. Cut into 2cm/1in pieces using a large, sharp knife.


Thread the corn pieces onto skewers, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a griddle pan until hot and griddle the corn skewers until golden-brown on all sides.


For the chilli herb drizzle, mix all the ingredients together in a small bowl.


To serve, place the corn skewers onto a serving plate and pour over the chilli herb drizzle. Garnish with lime wedges.
