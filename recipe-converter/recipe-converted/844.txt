Ingredients
For the vegetable tempura

300ml/½ pint vegetable oil, for deep frying
200g/7oz self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting
150ml/¼ pint cold sparkling water
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 carrot, peeled and cut into batons
¼ cauliflower, cut into florets
55g/2oz broccoli, cut into florets
¼ onion, cut into wedges

For the lemon, chilli and soy dressing

½ lemon, juice only
3 tbsp soy sauce
pinch chilli flakes
salt and freshly ground black pepper

To serve

1 tbsp chopped fresh chives
1 lemon, cut into wedges




Method


For the vegetable tempura, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-based saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Place the flour into a large bowl and add enough cold sparkling water to make a thick batter. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Dredge the vegetables in flour and dust off the excess. Dip the vegetables into the batter, then carefully place into the hot oil. Deep fry for 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Place onto a serving plate.


For the dressing, whisk the lemon juice, soy sauce, chilli flakes, salt and freshly ground black pepper together in a bowl. Pour into a small dipping bowl and place alongside the tempura.


To serve, garnish with chives and lemon wedges.
