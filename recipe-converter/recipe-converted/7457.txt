Ingredients

3 macaroon biscuits
1 orange, juice and zest
1 pear, peeled and sliced
3 free-range egg whites
75g/2¾oz caster sugar
50g/1¾oz dark chocolate, grated




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Place the macaroons in a pile onto a baking sheet. Sprinkle over the orange juice and zest and top with the sliced pear.


In a bowl, whisk together the egg whites until stiff. Add the caster sugar and whisk again until stiff and glossy peaks are made when removing the whisk from the mixture.


Spoon the egg mixture over the macaroon and pear base to cover completely. Then place into the preheated oven to bake for three minutes, or until golden.


To serve, place onto a plate and sprinkle with grated chocolate.
