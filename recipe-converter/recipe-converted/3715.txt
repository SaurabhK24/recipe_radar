Ingredients

25g/1oz butter
1 small onion, finely chopped
225g/8oz button mushrooms, finely chopped
leaves from 1 sprig of thyme
freshly grated nutmeg
6 large eggs
6 tsp double cream
40g/1½oz Gruyére cheese, finely grated
salt
freshly ground black pepper

For the herb salad and lemon oil dressing,

handful of baby leaf salad
sprigs of flat-leaf parsley, tarragon, chervil, chives, fennel and dill
lemon olive oil or extra virgin olive oil
salt




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas Mark 6. Melt the butter in a medium-sized pan, add the onion and cook gently until soft but not coloured.


Add the mushrooms and thyme and continue to cook until all the excess liquid has evaporated and the mixture is quite dry. Season to taste with salt, pepper and nutmeg.


Spoon the mushroom mixture into six lightly buttered ramekin dishes. Break in the eggs, season them lightly, then spoon over the cream and sprinkle with the Gruyére cheese.


Put the ramekins into a shallow roasting tin and pour some hot water around them so that it comes about half way up the sides of the dishes. Bake for 15 minutes until the eggs are set but the yolks are still runny and the cheese is lightly golden.


Serve with a mixture of seasoned baby salad leaves and herbs, dressed in lemon olive oil or extra virgin olive oil.
