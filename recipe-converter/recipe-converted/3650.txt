The secret of success in this recipe is to leave the lamb to cook on a very low heat. Serve this springtime dish with plenty of bread to mop up the sauce.

Ingredients

1kg/2lb 4oz boned lamb shoulder, cut into large chunks
salt and freshly ground black pepper
150ml/5fl oz extra virgin olive oil
2 onions, roughly chopped
1 large carrot, sliced
1 celery stalk, roughly chopped
5 garlic cloves, crushed
Â½ x 50g/2oz tin anchovy fillets
handful thyme sprigs
1 red chilli, sliced
250ml/9fl oz white wine
25ml/1fl oz white wine vinegar
250g/9oz fresh or frozen peas
400g/14oz potatoes, cut into quarters
200g/7oz cherry tomatoes, halved

Method


Season the lamb chunks with salt and freshly ground black pepper and set aside.


Heat the olive oil in a large lidded pan and fry the onions, carrot and celery for 4-5 minutes, or until softened.


Add the garlic, anchovies, thyme and chilli, and continue to cook, stirring, until the anchovies have almost dissolved into the oil. Add the lamb chunks and fry for a further 4-5 minutes, or until browned all over.


Stir in the wine and continue to cook until the volume of the liquid has reduced by half, then add the vinegar. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer gently for 20 minutes.


Add the peas, potatoes and tomatoes, cover again and continue to cook for about an hour, until the sauce has reduced by half.


Serve hot with plenty of bread to mop up the sauce.
