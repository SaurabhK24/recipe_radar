Ingredients
For the veal escalope

1 tbsp olive oil
25g/1oz butter
100g/3Â½ oz veal, flattened with a meat mallet or rolling pin
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the garlic cream mushrooms

1 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp butter
85g/3oz button mushrooms, quartered
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 tbsp grain mustard
2 tbsp clotted cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp chopped fresh chives

To serve

handful of fresh herb leaves




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the veal escalope, heat the oil and butter in a pan and season the veal with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fry for 1-2 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown, then transfer to the oven for 4-5 minutes, or until cooked through. Remove and allow to rest on a warm plate.


For the garlic cream mushrooms, heat the oil and butter in a frying pan and gently fry the mushrooms and garlic for 4-5 minutes, or until the mushrooms are browned. Stir in the mustard, cream and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes, then stir in the chives.


Spoon the creamy mushrooms onto a serving plate and place the veal on top. Place a handful of fresh herbs to the side and serve.
