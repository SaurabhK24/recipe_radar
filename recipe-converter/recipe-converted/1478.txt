Ingredients
For the sponge

140g/5oz butternut squash, peeled and chopped
pinch dried ground ginger
110g/4oz butter
110g/4oz plain flour
110g/4oz caster sugar
2 free-range eggs
1 tbsp baking powder
1 tbsp clear honey

For the orange cream sauce

142ml/5fl oz double cream
30g/1oz caster sugar
½ orange, peeled and segmented




Method


For the sponge, place the squash into a small heatproof bowl with the ground ginger and a splash of water. Cover with cling film and cook in the microwave on the highest setting for 4 minutes.


Meanwhile, place the butter, flour, sugar, eggs and baking powder into a food processor and blend until smooth. With the motor still running, gradually add the cooked squash.


Grease another small heatproof bowl and drizzle the honey into the base of the bowl. Pour in the sponge mixture and cover with cling film. Place into the microwave and cook on the highest setting for a further four minutes, or until cooked through.


For the orange cream sauce, heat the cream in a saucepan and add the sugar. Stir until the sugar has dissolved, then add the orange segments.


To serve, turn the pudding out onto a plate and pour over the orange cream sauce.
