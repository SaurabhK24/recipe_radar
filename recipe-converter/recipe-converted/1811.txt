Ingredients
For the steak skewers

100g/3½oz rump steak
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp olive oil

For the salad

1 carrot, peeled and sliced into ribbons with a peeler
1 tbsp fresh chopped coriander
1 tbsp fresh chopped mint
1 tbsp fresh chopped basil
½ tsp salt
½ lime, juice only
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
2 tbsp olive oil

To serve

fresh coriander leaves




Method


Soak three wooden skewers in a bowl of cold water for 10-12 minutes, then drain and set aside.


For the steak, cut the meat into strips and thread onto the skewers. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and drizzle with the oil. Heat a chargrill pan until smoking, then add the skewers and fry for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until browned all over and cooked to your liking.


For the salad, combine the carrot and herbs in a bowl and add the rest of the ingredients. Toss well to coat, then transfer to a serving plate.


Serve the skewers on top of the salad, garnished with the coriander leaves.
