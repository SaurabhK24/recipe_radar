Ingredients

2 large ripe tomatoes
50g/1¾oz fresh breadcrumbs
1 tsp each chopped chervil, dill, parsley
½ garlic clove, crushed
1 tbsp cheddar cheese, grated
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for rubbing
1 small red pepper
35g/1¼oz rocket
squeeze lemon juice




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Scoop the insides of the tomatoes out leaving the tomatoes whole.


Place the breadcrumbs, herbs, garlic, cheese and salt and freshly ground black pepper into a bowl and mix together. Stuff the tomatoes with the breadcrumb mixture.


Place the tomatoes on a baking sheet and cook in the oven for six minutes.


Heat a frying pan over a high heat. Rub the pepper with a little of the olive oil and fry whole in a frying pan until charred all sides.


Place the pepper into a bowl, cover with cling film and leave for 2-3 minutes.


Remove the cling film, peel the pepper, discarding the charred skin, and slice into strips.


Place the pepper strips, rocket, olive oil and lemon juice into a bowl and mix together.


To serve, place the rocket and pepper salad onto a serving plate and place the roasted tomatoes on top.
