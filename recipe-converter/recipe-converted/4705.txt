Ingredients
For the trout

½ lemon, zest only
1 trout fillet, skin removed
½ tsp cumin seeds
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp olive oil
3 spring onions, trimmed and halved lengthwise
½ tomato

For the lemon soy vinaigrette

2 tbsp soy sauce
½ lemon, zest and juice only

For the herbed couscous

150g/5½oz couscous
300ml/10fl oz vegetable stock
2 tbsp olive oil
½ lemon, juice only
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp chopped fresh mint
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives
1 tbsp chopped fresh dill
½ tomato, chopped




Method


For the trout, rub the lemon zest into the flesh of the trout. Place the cumin seeds, salt and freshly ground black pepper into a pestle and mortar and grind together until well combined. Reserve half a teaspoon for the vinaigrette and sprinkle the rest over the fish.


Heat the olive oil in a griddle pan and add the trout, spring onions and tomato half. Griddle the trout for 2-3 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown and cooked through.


For the vinaigrette, place the soy sauce, lemon zest and juice and the reserved cumin mixture into a small bowl and whisk well to combine.


For the couscous, pour the stock over the couscous in a bowl and allow to soak for 5-7 minutes, or until all of the liquid is absorbed. Fluff the grains up with a fork and stir in the rest of the couscous ingredients.


To serve, spoon the couscous onto a serving plate and arrange the trout on top. Place the grilled spring onions and tomato half to the side, drizzle over the vinaigrette and serve.
