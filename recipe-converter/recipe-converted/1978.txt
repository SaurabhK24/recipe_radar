Ingredients

75g/3oz dark chocolate, melted, plus extra to serve
50g/2oz unsalted butter, melted
2 whole free-range eggs, beaten
50g/2oz caster sugar
50g/2oz plain flour
50g/2oz pitted cherries from a can, chopped
2 tbsp juice from a can of cherries
butter, for greasing




Method


Place the chocolate, butter, eggs and sugar into a bowl and mix together well.


Add the flour, cherries and cherry juice and fold together until smooth.


Grease two ramekins with butter, then spoon the mixture into each until three-quarters full. Cover each with cling film, place into the microwave and cook on full power for four minutes, or until risen and cooked through.


To serve, turn the puddings out onto plates and drizzle with the melted chocolate.
