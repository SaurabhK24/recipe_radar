A little chilli adds warmth to chocolate dishes without making them really spicy. Try making it in advance for a dinner party.






By Gino D'Acampo


From Ready Steady Cook






Ingredients

100g/3½oz milk chocolate, chopped
1 red chilli, chopped
300ml/½ pint double cream, whipped to soft peaks
icing sugar, to dust




Method


Place the chocolate into a bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water and heat, stirring occasionally, until melted.


Stir in almost all of the chilli. Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly.


Fold the melted chocolate into the whipped cream in a large bowl, then spoon into a serving dish. Chill until needed.


To serve, scatter with the reserved chilli and dust with icing sugar.
