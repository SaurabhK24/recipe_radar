Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
¼ onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
100g/3½oz wild mushrooms, cleaned and chopped
150g/5½oz long grain rice
50ml/2fl oz white wine
200ml/7fl oz hot vegetable stock
25g/1oz butter
50ml/2fl oz double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tsp fresh thyme leaves




Method


Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat, add the chopped onion and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until softened but not browned.


Add the garlic and mushrooms and cook for 3-4 minutes.


Add the rice and stir to coat all the grains with oil. Turn up the heat, add the white wine and simmer for 2-3 minutes.


Reduce the heat and gradually add the stock, a ladleful at a time, until all the liquid has been absorbed.


Stir in the butter and cream and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, place the risotto into a bowl and sprinkle over the thyme leaves.
