Ingredients

3 tbsp icing sugar
½ mango, skin on, stone removed, sliced into wedges lengthways




Method


Sprinkle the icing sugar onto a plate and dredge the cut sides of the mango in the sugar until coated.


Using a chefs' blow torch, heat the sugar-coated mango wedges until golden-brown and caramelised . (Alternatively, preheat the grill to its highest setting and heat the mango wedges for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown.) Serve immediately.
