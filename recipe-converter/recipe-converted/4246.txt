Ingredients

100ml/3½fl oz olive oil
1 red onion, peeled, finely sliced
1 tbsp sherry
2 garlic cloves, peeled, crushed
2 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp dried chili flakes
8 plum tomatoes, chopped
12 raw king prawns, shells and heads removed
100g/3½oz breadcrumbs (preferably brioche)
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
salt and freshly ground black pepper
crusty bread, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Heat one tablespoon of the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and fry the onion for 4-5 minutes, or until softened. Add the sherry and cook for a further 1-2 minutes, or until the volume of the liquid has reduced slightly.


Add the garlic, paprika, chilli, tomatoes and the remaining oil and cook for a further 18-20 minutes, or until the sauce is thick and the tomatoes have softened.


Stir in the prawns and spoon into an ovenproof dish. Sprinkle over the breadcrumbs and bake for 15-17 minutes, or until golden-brown on top.


Serve immediately with the crusty bread.
