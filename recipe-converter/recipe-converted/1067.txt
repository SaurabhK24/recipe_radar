Ingredients

3 tbsp olive oil
½ onion, diced
3 tbsp brown sugar
2 tbsp red wine
100g/3½oz cherry tomatoes
1 tsp fresh thyme leaves
2 handfuls watercress
25g/1oz blue cheese




Method


Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over a medium heat. Once hot, add the onion, brown sugar, red wine, tomatoes and thyme and cook for seven minutes, stirring gently, until the tomatoes have browned and are beginning to soften.


Add the watercress and gently mix so as not to break up the tomatoes.


To serve, place on a plate and sprinkle with the blue cheese.
