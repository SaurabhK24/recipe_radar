Ingredients
For the wild garlic pesto

120g/4oz wild garlic leaves, blanched
1 garlic clove, peeled and grated
20g/¾oz pine nuts, toasted
200ml/7fl oz olive oil
½ lemon, zest only
30g/1oz parmesan cheese, grated
salt and pepper

For the grilled lamb chops and potatoes

6 lamb cutlets, French trimmed
olive oil, to brush on the lamb
200g/7oz pre-cooked Jersey Royals
30g/1oz wild garlic leaves, washed




Method


For the wild garlic pesto, pick and wash the wild garlic leaves and blanch the leaves in a pan of boiling water for 30 seconds. Re-fresh in a bowl of ice-cold water. Squeeze out the excess water and roughly chop.


Add the leaves, garlic, pine nuts, olive oil, lemon zest and grated parmesan to the food processor and blend. Season with salt and pepper.


For the grilled lamb chops, heat a flat griddle pan and drizzle the chops with oil. Cook for two minutes on one side and turn over and cook for another 30 seconds. Allow the chops to rest.


While the lamb is resting, heat a medium frying pan and fry the potatoes with butter until golden-brown. Stir through the raw garlic leaves, and a tablespoon of the pesto, or more if you prefer.


To serve, put the potato salad in a serving bowl and pile the lamb chops on top. Put a little extra pesto on top if liked. Any remaining pesto can be kept in the fridge to use for another recipe.
