Ingredients

½ mango, stone removed
1 tbsp honey
pinch ground cinnamon

To serve

2 tbsp Greek-style yoghurt
icing sugar, for dusting
1 sprig fresh mint




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Using a sharp knife, carefully score the mango flesh in a criss-cross pattern, being careful not to slice through the skin. Push the skin inside out to form the mango half into a 'hedgehog' shape.


Place the mango half on a baking tray, drizzle over the honey, sprinkle with cinnamon and bake in the oven for about 2-3 minutes, or until beginning to caramelise.


To serve, transfer the mango 'hedgehog' onto a serving plate and spoon some yoghurt alongside. Dust with icing sugar and garnish with a sprig of mint.
