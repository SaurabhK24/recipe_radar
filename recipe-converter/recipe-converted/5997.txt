Once melted set aside to cool.


Beat the eggs and sugar in a bowl until thick and pale. Using a metal spoon, fold the chocolate into the egg mixture.


Gently fold in the crushed hazelnuts and brandy and then the whipped cream.


Divide the raspberries and strawberries between four dessert glasses.
