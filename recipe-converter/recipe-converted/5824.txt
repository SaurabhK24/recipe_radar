Ingredients

275g/9¾oz caster sugar
3 lemons, rind and juice only
275 ml/9¾fl oz sherry or wine
150 ml/5¼fl oz brandy
725 ml/1 pint 6fl oz double cream

For the ginger snaps

150g/5¼oz self-raising flour
½ tsp baking soda
½ tsp cinnamon
½ tsp ginger
¼ tsp cloves
110g/4oz soft brown sugar
100g/4oz butter, softened
½ beaten egg
40g/1½oz golden syrup
granulated sugar, for coating




Method


Mix the caster sugar with the lemon juice; add the rind, sherry or wine, and brandy.


Warm slightly in a bowl over hot water (a bain marie) to dissolve the sugar and blend the flavours. Do not overheat the mixture.


Whip the cream into soft peaks and fold into the liquid.


Pour into tall glasses and let the mixture rest and separate.


To make the biscuits, preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5. Combine the flour, baking soda and spices in a bowl and set aside.


Now cream the sugar and butter. Once combined, beat in the egg and golden syrup until light and fluffy.


Stir in the flour mixture and combine. Using a teaspoon, spoon small amounts of the mixture onto a lightly greased baking sheet around 5cm/2in apart. Slightly flatten down and sprinkle with sugar.


Bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes. Serve with the syllabub.
