4 tbsp olive oil
2 shallots, finely chopped
200ml/7fl oz white wine
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
200g/7oz mussels, cleaned and de-bearded (discard any that don't close when gently tapped)

50g/1¾oz winkles, cleaned
50g/1¾oz brown shrimp, cleaned

Method


Prepare the plaice, trim off the fins, head and tail, take off the dark skin and leaving the white skin on the underside.


Heat a large lidded saucepan and add the olive oil, once hot add the shallots, wine and parsley along with the mussels, clams and parsley and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the mussels and clams they have opened.


Remove the mussels and clams and set aside. Discard any that have not opened. Simmer the remaining liquid and cook until the volume of liquid has reduced by two thirds.


Heat a non-stick frying pan, add the remaining olive oil and cook the plaice for 6-8 minutes.


Gently warm the shellfish reduction over a low heat and whisk in the butter. Once the sauce has emulsified, blend using a stick blender and then reduce further. Add the squid, winkles, brown shrimp, lemon juice and wild garlic. Simmer for 1-2 minutes until the squid is cooked.
