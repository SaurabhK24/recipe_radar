From Paul Hollywood's Bread






Ingredients

150ml/5fl oz whole milk
1½ tbsp plain flour
400g/14oz Irish cheddar cheese, grated
160g/6oz breadcrumbs
1 tsp English mustard powder
120ml/4fl oz stout
2 free-range eggs, yolks only
4 spring onions, finely chopped
6 slices toasted soda bread




Method


Warm the milk in a saucepan and whisk in the flour. Keep stirring and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer. The milk should thicken slightly.


Add the cheese and stir over a low heat until it has melted. Add the breadcrumbs, mustard and stout. Continue stirring until the mixture comes together, it should leave the sides of the pan.


Remove from the heat and tip into a bowl, leave to cool slightly. Once cooled add the egg yolks and beat vigorously with a wooden spoon until the egg is thoroughly mixed in. Add the chopped spring onions.


Spread the rarebit on toasted soda bread and place under a hot grill until bubbling and golden-brown.
