This is the best recipe for a glut of courgettes, hands-down. The creamy soup covers tender, diced pieces of courgette that add a contrasting texture.

Ingredients

60ml/2fl oz extra virgin olive oil
1 tbsp chopped garlic
handful basil leaves (preferably Italian), chopped
sea salt and ground white pepper, to taste
1kg/2¼lb green courgettes, cut lengthways into quarters then into 1cm/½in slices
750ml/1¼ pint chicken stock
60ml/2fl oz single cream
handful flatleaf parsley, chopped
50g/2oz freshly grated parmesan, plus extra to serve

To serve

crusty bread

Method


Heat the oil in a heavy-based pan over a medium heat.


Cook the garlic, basil, salt and courgette slowly for 10 minutes, or until the courgettes are lightly browned and softened.


Add white pepper, to taste, then pour in the stock and simmer for 8 minutes, uncovered. Remove from the heat.


Put three-quarters of the soup mixture into a food processor and blend until smooth.


Return the mixture to the pan and stir in the cream, parsley and parmesan.


To serve, ladle the soup into a bowl and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Sprinkle over more parmesan, to taste. Serve with crusty bread and a green salad.
