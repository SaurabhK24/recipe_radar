Method

Flatten the swordfish slices between two sheets of cling film using the flat side of a meat cleaver.


Divide the filling mixture into 8 small sausage shapes by pressing it in your hand. Place on the swordfish and roll, ensuring the sides are closed. Secure with cocktail sticks.


Fry in oil until golden brown, turning to get even browning all over.
