Ingredients
For the meatballs

1 tbsp olive oil
200g/7oz pork mince
pinch dried oregano
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the batter

110g/4oz plain flour
pinch salt
2 free-range eggs, beaten
290ml/Â½ pint milk




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Heat the oil in a small ovenproof frying pan. Place the mince and oregano into a large bowl, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix well. Roll the mixture into golfball-sized balls. Place the meatballs into the pan and fry until golden-brown on all sides.


Meanwhile, for the batter, place the flour and salt into a large bowl, make a well in the middle and gradually whisk in the eggs and milk to make a thick, smooth batter. Leave to rest for five minutes.


Heat the frying pan, with the meatballs in, until very hot and pour the batter over the meatballs.


Transfer to the oven and cook for 10-12 minutes, or until the batter is well-risen and golden-brown on top and the meatballs are completely cooked through.


To serve, transfer to a serving plate.
