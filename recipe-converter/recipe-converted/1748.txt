Ingredients

100g/3½oz spaghetti
3 tbsp olive oil
100g/3½oz broccoli, cut into small florets
1 garlic clove, finely sliced
½ red chilli, finely sliced
1 tbsp flaked almonds
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the spaghetti for 8 minutes, until al dente.


Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a saucepan over a high heat and add the broccoli. Leave it for 1 minute before moving so the broccoli chars, then turn and char on the other sides for about 3 minutes.


Add the garlic, chilli and almonds and stir-fry for a further 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.


Drain the spaghetti and add to the broccoli pan, stir well to combine and serve.
