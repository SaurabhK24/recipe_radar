Ingredients
For the parsnip soup

50g/1¾oz unsalted butter
1 shallot, roughly chopped
1 garlic clove, roughly chopped
500g/1lb 2oz parsnips, peeled, cut into medium chunks
2 sprigs fresh thyme
1 tbsp honey
2 tsp medium curry powder
400ml/14fl oz vegetable stock
100ml/3½fl oz double cream
1 tbsp rapeseed oil
50g/1¾oz spinach

For the scallops

2 tbsp rapeseed oil
4 hand-dived scallops in their shells, meat removed and cleaned
4 tbsp coriander cress




Method


For the soup, melt the butter in a large saucepan. Add the shallot and garlic and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the parsnips, thyme, honey and curry powder and cook for a further 2-3 minutes. Pour in the stock and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until the parsnips are tender.


Transfer to a blender and blend until smooth. Pour back into the pan, stir in the cream and gently warm though.


Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large frying pan. Add the spinach and a few tablespoons water, then cook until wilted. Keep warm.


For the scallops, heat the oil in a large frying pan. Once hot, add the scallops and cook for 1 minute on each side, or until just cooked through. Remove from the pan and season with salt and pepper. Set aside to rest for a few minutes before serving.


To serve, divide the wilted spinach between shallow serving bowls and pour over the hot soup. Garnish with the scallops and coriander cress.
