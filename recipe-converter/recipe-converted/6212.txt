Ingredients

1 pandoro (sweet Italian bread)
300ml/½pint double cream
250g/9oz mascarpone cheese
1 lemon, finely grated zest only
splash maraschino liqueur
2 tbsp icing sugar, plus extra to dust
gold candles, to decorate (optional)




Method


Cut the pandoro horizontally into four.


In a large bowl, whisk together the cream, mascarpone, lemon zest, maraschino and icing sugar, until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed.


Divide the mixture between the layers of pandoro and carefully spread out to the edges.


Reconstruct the pandoro in layers on a serving plate and dust liberally with icing sugar and serve. Decorate with gold candles, if you like.
