This blood-red punch is perfect for a Halloween party. Just add a slug of gin or vodka for a grown-up version.



Ingredients

500ml/18fl oz cranberry juice
1.5 litres/2½ pints lemonade
3 limes, juice only
large handful gummi worms




Method


Pour all of the ingredients into a large glass bowl and mix until well combined.


Drape the gummi worms over the edge of the bowl.




Recipe Tips
To make it extra spooky – rinse a food-grade rubber glove and turn it inside out. Fill with water, tie the top with an elastic band and freeze until solid. Turn the frozen ‘hand’ out into the punch.
