Ingredients
For the bananas

25g/¾oz butter
2 tbsp caster sugar
1 banana, sliced into large chunks

For the filo parcel

110g/4oz ready-made filo pastry
110g/4oz butter, melted
2 tsp ground cinnamon
4 tsp caster sugar
125g/4½oz dried apricots
40g/1½oz whole almonds, roughly chopped
2 tbsp honey
1 orange, zest only
2 tsp icing sugar
ice cream, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Heat a frying pan until hot, then add the butter and caster sugar.


Add the bananas and fry until just golden, then set aside and allow to cool.


Place one sheet of filo pastry onto a baking sheet and brush generously with some of the melted butter. Dust with half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon and one teaspoon of caster sugar.


Repeat this layer and dusting with a second, third and fourth layer of filo pastry, butter, cinnamon and sugar.


Place the bananas along the length of the middle of the top filo sheet.


Place the apricots, almonds, honey and orange zest into a bowl and mix well. Spoon the apricot mixture over the top of the bananas.


Fold the sides of the filo pastry over the filling and roll it over, so that the join is underneath.


Spread with more of the melted butter and dust with icing sugar.


Place into the oven and bake for 15 minutes, or until the filo is crisp and golden.


To serve, cut the filo parcel into wedges and serve with a dollop of ice cream.
