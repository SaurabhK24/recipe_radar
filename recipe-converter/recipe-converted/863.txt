Smoked cheese replaces bacon in this creamy veggie version of spaghetti carbonara. Use sundried tomatoes for a more savoury taste, while semi-dried tomatoes will be sweeter.






By Simon Rimmer






Ingredients

450g/1lb spaghetti
7 tbsp double cream
1 garlic clove, crushed
100g/3½oz smoked cheddar, grated
freshly ground black pepper
3 free-range eggs, beaten
100g/3½oz baby spinach
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
60g/2oz sun-dried or semi-dried tomatoes in oil, drained and chopped
grated Parmesan, or similar vegetarian grating cheese




Method


Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to packet instructions.


Meanwhile, put the cream and garlic in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add the smoked cheddar and allow to melt over a low heat. You may need to stir it vigorously to make a smooth mixture. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.


Add the beaten egg to the cheese sauce a little at a time, stirring constantly until each addition is smoothly incorporated. (If there are a few lumps of cheese, it really doesn't matter.) Season with freshly ground black pepper.


When cooked, drain the spaghetti in a large colander. Return the spaghetti pan to the heat and add the spinach leaves. Stir until the spinach softens, adding a splash of water if it begins to stick. Stir the spaghetti in to the spinach.


Pour the cheese sauce over the spaghetti and spinach. Add the sun-dried tomatoes and parsley. Toss everything together until the spaghetti is completely coated. Serve immediately, preferably with a crisp green salad and a grating of Parmesan.




Recipe Tips
Warming the serving bowls up ahead of time will help make the pasta stay creamy and hot for longer.
