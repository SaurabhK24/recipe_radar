Ingredients

2 tbsp olive oil
½ potato, sliced
1 tbsp butter
¼ leek, sliced
100ml/3½oz double cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tsp olive oil
2 partridge breasts
1 tbsp brandy
100ml/3½oz double cream




Method


In an ovenproof frying pan, heat the oil and cook the potato slices for around 15-20 minutes or until golden.


Meanwhile, heat the butter in a sauce pan and fry the leeks for 5-8 minutes or until soft. Add the cream and cook for a further three minutes. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


In a frying pan heat one tsp olive oil, when hot fry the partridge breasts for 1-2 minutes on each side.


Remove the partridge breasts from the pan and set them aside somewhere warm while you make the sauce.


Tip the brandy into the pan to de-glaze. Stir and add the cream. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, place the potatoes on a plate. Top with the leeks, then top with the partridge breast. Pour over the brandy sauce.
