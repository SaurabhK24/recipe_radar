Ingredients
For the tart

125g/4½oz self-raising flour
50g/2oz set butter, cubed
1 free-range egg
1 tbsp milk
1 pear, sliced
2 tbsp soft brown sugar
1 tbsp walnuts, finely chopped

For the chocolate and whipped cream drizzle

4 tbsp double cream
2 tbsp cocoa powder
1 tbsp icing sugar
75ml/2½fl oz double cream




Method


For the pear and walnut tart, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Place the flour and butter into a blender or food processor and blend until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.


Add the egg and milk and blend until it forms a ball. Turn out onto a flat surface, knead into a ball and then roll to the thickness of a pound coin.


Cut out a 20cm/10in rectangle, prick with a fork, top with the sliced pear and sprinkle over half the sugar.


Slide onto a baking sheet and bake for five minutes. Add the rest of the sugar and the walnuts and bake for another three minutes, or until the pastry is golden. Remove from the oven and place onto a large serving plate.


For the chocolate sauce, whisk together the cream, cocoa powder and icing sugar in a small saucepan over a low heat until well combined.


To serve, cut a slice of the tart, pour over the double cream and drizzle with plenty of chocolate sauce.
