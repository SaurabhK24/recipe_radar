1 tsp thyme
1 tsp marjoram
1 clove garlic
85g/3oz goats' cheese cheddar (a hard cheddar-like cheese) - cut into 1cm/in cubes

Method


Lay the sheets on a damp surface to prevent drying out. Cut into a rectangle.


Place the cheese, herbs and oil in a bowl and mix together.


Put the mixture in the centre of the rectangle and roll up into a spring roll shape.


Twist both the ends to make a cracker shape.


Brush with oil and bake in an oven 200C/400F/Gas 6 for 4 minutes to crisp up.
