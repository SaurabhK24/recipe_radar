Ingredients
For the dough

200g/7oz plain flour
3 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing
3 tbsp water
2 tbsp tomato purée

For the topping

1 tbsp olive oil
100g/3½oz wild mushrooms
30g/1oz sun-blushed tomatoes, chopped
55g/2oz goats' cheese, crumbled




Method


Preheat oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and oil a baking sheet.


Mix the flour, olive oil and water together in a bowl to make a soft dough.


On a clean flat surface, roll the dough out into a thin disc and lay onto the oiled baking sheet.


Spread the tomato puré over the dough disc.


Meanwhile, for the topping, heat the olive oil in a frying pan over a high heat. Add the mushrooms and sun-blushed tomato and fry for two minutes.


Spread the mushroom mixture over the pizza, crumble over the goats' cheese and transfer to the oven and cook for 6-8 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the base is crisp and golden.
