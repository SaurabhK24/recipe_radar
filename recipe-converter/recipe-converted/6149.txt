Yoghurt and orange are a great combination in this moist cake recipe. It will also keep for several days in an airtight container if you can resist eating it all at once!

Ingredients
For the cake

125g/4½oz full-fat Greek-style yoghurt
50ml/2fl oz vegetable oil
1 lemon, zest only
1 orange, zest only
3 free-range eggs
125g/4½ caster sugar
200g/7oz plain flour
2 tsp baking powder

For the glaze

75g/3oz marmalade
1 tbsp orange juice

To serve

Greek-style yoghurt




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease and line a 450g/1lb loaf tin.


In a large bowl beat together the yoghurt, vegetable oil, lemon and orange zest and eggs until light and fluffy. Sift in all the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.


Spoon the mixture into the loaf tin and bake for about 45 minutes. (Test the cake by inserting a skewer into the centre. If the skewer comes out clean, the cake is done.)


Remove from the oven and leave to cool a little in the tin.


Meanwhile for the glaze, warm the marmalade and orange juice until the marmalade melts. Pour the glaze over the cake and set aside to cool completely.


Remove the cake from the tin and serve with lashings of Greek-style yoghurt.
