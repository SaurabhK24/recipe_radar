Method


Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.


Heat a frying pan until hot and add the olive oil and butter.


Season the chicken and place in the pan skin side down.


Fry for three minutes until golden then turn over and place in the oven.


Roast for eight minutes until tender then remove and rest for five minutes.


In a saucepan put the water, sugar, salt and butter then the carrots, bring to the boil and turn down to a simmer.


The carrots should have only a small amount of liquid left. Remove the lid and allow to reduce until it's the consistency of a thick syrup on a high heat, then add the chopped herbs and serve with the chicken.
