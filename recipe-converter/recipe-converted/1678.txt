Ingredients

carrots
allow 450g/1lb of pounded sugar to every 450g/1lb of carrot pulp
1 lemon, the grated rind of
2 lemons, the strained juice of
6 chopped bitter almonds
2 tbsp brandy




Method


Select young carrots; wash and scrape them clean, cut them into round pieces, put them into a saucepan with sufficient water to cover them, and let them simmer until perfectly soft; then beat them through a sieve.


Weigh the pulp, and to every 450g/1lb, allow the above ingredients. Put the pulp into a preserving-pan with the sugar, and let this boil for 5 minutes, stirring and skimming all the time.


When cold, add the lemon-rind and juice, almonds and brandy; mix these well with the jam; then put it into pots which must be well covered and kept in a dry place. The brandy may be omitted, but the preserve will then not keep; with the brandy it will keep for months.
