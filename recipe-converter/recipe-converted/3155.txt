Ingredients

butter, for greasing
3 free-range egg whites
1 free-range egg yolk
1 tbsp cornflour
55g/2oz cheese, grated
55g/2oz frozen peas, defrosted
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Grease the inside of one 10cm/4in ovenproof frying pan, or two 7.5cm/3in ramekin dishes with butter.


Whisk the egg whites in a clean, dry bowl until stiff peaks are formed when the whisk is removed.


In a separate bowl, mix the egg yolk, cornflour, cheese and peas together and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Fold the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture and carefully spoon into the pan or ramekins.


Place on a baking tray and bake in the oven for 7-8 minutes, or until well risen and golden.


Serve immediately.
