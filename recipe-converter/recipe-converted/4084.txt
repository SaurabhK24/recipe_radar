Ingredients

112g/3¾oz plus 1 tsp golden caster sugar
25g/1oz plus 1 tsp cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
juice of 2 limes
freshly grated lime zest of 1 lime




Method


In a heavy saucepan cook the sugar, butter, eggs and lime juice over a moderately low heat. Whisk frequently, until it is thick enough to hold marks of whisk, about 12-15 minutes.


Immediately pour the curd through a sieve into a bowl. Stir in the zest of one lime and cool. Lime curd can be made up to a week in advance, its surface covered with cling film.
