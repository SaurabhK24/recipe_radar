Ingredients

1.5kg/3lb 5oz cooking apples
½ lemon, juice only
100g/3½oz light muscovado sugar

For the topping

50g/1¾oz plain flour
50g/1¾oz porridge oats
150g/5½oz light muscovado sugar
150g/5½oz walnuts, roughly chopped
50g/1¾oz sunflower seeds
100g/3½oz softened butter




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4 (160C fan).


Peel and core the apples, then cut them into thin slices. Place in a small flameproof casserole with the lemon juice, sugar and six tablespoonfuls of water. Bring to the boil, then place in the oven and cook for about 20 minutes, or until the apple is tender but has not fallen to a pulp.


Put the dry topping ingredients in a mixing bowl and rub in the butter until it is evenly distributed and the mixture has formed small clumps. Spread the mixture evenly over a baking tray and bake for about 20 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp.


Stir to break up the crumble and sprinkle over the hot apple.
