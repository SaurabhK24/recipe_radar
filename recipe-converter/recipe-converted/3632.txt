Ingredients

2 tbsp olive oil
100g/3½oz mangetout, cut in half lengthways
100g/3½oz baby sweetcorn, cut in half lengthways
55g/2oz cashew nuts
150g/5oz duck breast, thinly sliced
1 tbsp honey
2 tsp soy sauce
½ tsp freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp sesame seeds




Method


Heat the oil in a wok until smoking. Add the mangetout, sweetcorn and cashew nuts and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender but retaining a bit of bite.


Add the duck breast slices to the wok and stir fry for 1-2 minutes, then add the rest of the ingredients. Cook until the sauce is reduced and sticky, and the duck is cooked to your liking.


Pile the stir-fry onto a serving plate and serve.
