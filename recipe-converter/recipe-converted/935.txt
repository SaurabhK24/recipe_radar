Ingredients

morello cherries
good french brandy
sugar (to every 450g/1lb of cherries allow half the quantity of pounded sugar)




Method


Have ready some wide-mouthed glass bottles, perfectly clean and dry.


Remove half the stalks from the cherries.


Put them in the bottles, strewing the sugar between each layer; and when the bottles are nearly full, pour in enough brandy to cover them.


A few blanched bitter almonds or peach kernals is thought to be an improvement.


Put corks or bungs in the bottles, tie them over with bladder, and store in a dry place. The cherries will be fit to eat in 2 or 3 months, and will keep well for years.
