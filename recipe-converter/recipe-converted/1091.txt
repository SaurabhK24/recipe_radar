Ingredients
For the chutney

6 baby carrots, peeled and chopped
2 tbsp vinegar
2 tbsp soft brown sugar
2 tbsp parsley, chopped
¼ peach, chopped

For the rarebit

55g/2oz butter
55g/2oz plain flour
¼pint-½pint milk
85g/3oz cheddar cheese, grated
dash worchester sauce
dash of Tabasco
1 tsp mustard powder
salt
freshly ground black pepper
2 slices of ciabatta/bread, toasted




Method


To make the chutney, heat the carrots in a small saucepan. Stir in the vinegar, sugar, parsley and peach pieces. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally.


For the rarebit, gently melt the butter in a pan. Stir in the flour to create a roux. Pour in the milk, and stir continually to create a thick sauce. Remove from the heat and stir in the cheese until melted.


Add the Worcester sauce, Tabasco, mustard powder and seasoning, and stir together, to create a thick, almost paste like mixture.


Spread the rarebit mix onto the toasted bread and grill for 2-3 minutes, until golden.


Transfer to a serving plate and spoon the chutney on to serve.
