Ingredients
For the king prawn and shiitake mushroom skewers

4 shiitake mushrooms
5 raw king prawns
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp honey
½ lemon, juice only
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the spicy spinach salad

100g/3½oz spinach
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp chilli flakes
1 lemon




Method


For the king prawn and shiitake mushroom skewers, thread the shiitake mushrooms and king prawns alternately onto two skewers and drizzle with olive oil.


Heat a griddle pan until hot and griddle the skewers for 3-4 minutes on each side. Add the honey and lemon juice, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and griddle for a further 1-2 minutes on each side, or until the mushrooms are tender and the prawns are completely cooked through.


For the spicy spinach salad, place the spinach into a bowl with the olive oil, chilli flakes and the juice of half the lemon and stir well.


To serve, place the spicy spinach salad onto a serving plate, top with the skewers and garnish with the remaining lemon half, cut into wedges.
