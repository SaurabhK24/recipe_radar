Celeriac has a wonderfully delicate flavour despite its knobbly appearance - here it's fried in cakes with seared salmon.

Ingredients

For the celeriac cakes

400g/14oz celeriac, grated
1 onion, finely sliced
1 free-range egg
2 tbsp plain flour
salt and freshly ground black pepper
50g/2oz unsalted butter
2 tbsp olive oil

For the dill dressing

1 tbsp Dijon mustard
1 tbsp caster sugar
1 tbsp chopped fresh dill
1 tbsp cider vinegar
1 clove garlic, crushed


4 x 150g/5oz salmon fillets
watercress
4 lemon wedges




Method


Place the grated celeriac in a clean tea towel or cloth and squeeze out the juices.


In a bowl combine the celeriac with the onion, egg and flour. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper and divide the mixture into four. Shape each piece into a ball and flatten into a cake shape.


Melt the butter with one tablespoon of oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Fry the celeriac cakes for about 3-5 minutes on each side. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper.


For the dressing, whisk all the ingredients together in a bowl.


Cut the salmon fillets into three long strips. Rub one side of the fish strips with oil and fry in a very hot frying pan for about one minute on that side only.


To serve, place a celeriac cake onto each of four plates, top them with salmon, garnish with lemon and watercress and spoon the dill dressing over.
