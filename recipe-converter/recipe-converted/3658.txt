Brilliant to make with little children over the holidays, these easy chocolate crispy cakes are a perennial favourite.



Ingredients

225g/8oz plain chocolate, broken into pieces
2 tbsp golden syrup
50g/2oz butter
75g/3oz cornflakes
36 mini chocolate eggs




Method


Line a 12-hole fairy cake tin with paper cases.


Melt the chocolate, golden syrup and butter in a bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water, (do not let the base of the bowl touch the water). Stir the mixture until smooth.


Remove the bowl from the heat and gently stir in the cornflakes until all of the cereal is coated in the chocolate.


Divide the mixture between the paper cases and press 3 chocolate eggs into the centre of each nest. Chill in the fridge for 1 hour, or until completely set.




Recipe Tips
Shredded wheat or puffed rice cereals can be used instead of the cornflakes.
