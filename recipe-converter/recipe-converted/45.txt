Ingredients
For the fritters

100g/3½oz self-raising flour
1 tsp salt
5 tbsp milk
100g/3½oz canned sweetcorn, rinsed and drained
1 tbsp vegetable oil

To serve

4 slices bacon, fried until crisp
2 tbsp honey, for drizzling




Method


Place the flour, salt and milk into a large bowl and whisk together to make a smooth batter. Stir in the sweetcorn.


Heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan and pour spoonfuls of the batter into the pan. Fry the fritters until golden-brown underneath, then turn over with a fish slice and fry until golden-brown on the other side. Remove from the pan and set aside to keep warm. Repeat the process with the remaining batter.


To serve, place the fritters onto serving plates, top with the bacon and drizzle over the honey.
