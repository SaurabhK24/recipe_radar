Ingredients
For the islands

200ml/8fl oz milk
25g/1oz caster sugar
6 free-range egg whites
200g/8oz caster sugar

For the custard

2 free-range egg yolks
25g/1oz caster sugar
500ml/17fl oz whole milk
½ tsp vanilla essence
3 tbsp lemon curd




Method


For the islands, heat the milk and sugar in a large saucepan over a medium heat,until simmering.


Meanwhile, whisk the egg whites in a clean bowl until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed. Gradually add the sugar, whisking it in bit by bit until the whites are glossy and stiff.


Carefully place spoonfuls of the egg white mixture into the hot milk and poach for a minute on each side or until cooked through.


For the custard, place the egg yolks, vanilla and sugar in a clean bowl and whisk them together. Pour the milk into a saucepan and bring up to the boil, then remove from the heat immediately. Gradually add the milk to the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly.


Pour the custard mixture back into the saucepan and stir over a gentle heat until thickened. Once thickened add the lemon curd and stir well.


Pour the custard into serving bowls and top with the meringue floating islands.
