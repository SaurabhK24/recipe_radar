A dash of cinnamon and chewy toffee make this moist apple cake really special. Great served as a dessert with custard or in slices with a cup of something hot.

Ingredients

115g/4oz self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting
115g/4oz self-raising wholemeal flour
100g/3½oz soft dark brown sugar
1 tsp baking powder
2 tsp ground cinnamon
5 tbsp sunflower oil
5 tbsp milk
2 free-range eggs
2 eating apples, peeled, cored and chopped into 5mm/¼in cubes
50g/2oz toffee, broken into small pieces




Method


Butter a 1.2 litres/2 pint heatproof bowl and dust with flour. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


In a bowl, mix the flours, sugar, baking powder and cinnamon together. In a separate bowl or jug, beat together the oil, milk and eggs. Pour this onto the dry ingredients and stir to combine. Fold in the apple and toffee pieces.


Pour into the prepared dish and bake for 50-60 minutes. Test the cake is cooked through by inserting a skewer into the centre, if it is cooked it will come out clean.


Leave in the dish to cool for 10 minutes then turn the cake out. Leave to cool completely and serve.
