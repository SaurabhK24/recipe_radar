Ingredients

2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp butter
1 plantain, peeled and sliced lengthways
1 tbsp ground cinnamon

To serve

40g/1½oz hoi sin sauce from a jar
110g/4oz wild garlic stem or garlic chives, blanched for 15 seconds then refreshed
20g/¾oz honey




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Season the chicken breast with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Heat an oven-proof frying pan until hot, then add the olive oil and half the butter.


When the butter is foaming add the chicken and fry, turning once, until golden-brown on both sides.


Transfer to the oven to roast for 10-12 minutes, or until completely cooked through. Remove from the oven and leave to rest in a warm place for five minutes.


For the plantain, heat a frying pan until hot, then add the remaining butter.


Dust the plantain with cinnamon and place into the frying pan to fry for 1-2 minutes on each side, until golden and tender.


To serve, place the wilted garlic stem onto one side of the plate. Place the plantain in the centre of the plate. Drizzle with hoi sin sauce.


Slice the chicken into three pieces on the diagonal and place it across the plantain. Finish by drizzling the honey over the chicken.
