Ingredients
For the panzanella

3 tbsp olive oil
3 slices stale good quality white bread, torn into pieces
salt and freshly ground black pepper
100g/3½oz new potatoes, cooked and thickly sliced
2 tbsp tinned chickpeas, rinsed and drained
3 small mushrooms, quartered

For the dressing

200ml/7fl oz tomato passata
2 tbsp olive oil




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the panzanella, heat the oil in a pan and fry the bread pieces for 2-3 minutes until golden-brown. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then add the potatoes, chickpeas and mushrooms together, stirring well to combine. Transfer to the oven to cook for another 4-5 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.


For the dressing, whisk the passata and olive oil together and drizzle over the panzanella. Toss to coat evenly, then serve.
