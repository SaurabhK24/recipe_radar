Ingredients

740g/1lb 10oz lamb fillet, trimmed and cubed
1 tsp olive oil
1 tsp dried oregano
1 lemon, finely grated rind only
½ tsp ground paprika
4 wholemeal pitta breads
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the Turkish salad

1 small cucumber, deseeded and chopped
4 firm, ripe tomatoes, deseeded and chopped
1 green pepper, cored, deseeded and chopped
1 small red onion, chopped
1 small bunch of mint, finely chopped
1 tbsp extra virgin rapeseed or olive oil
100g/3½oz reduced-fat feta cheese, diced
2 tbsp chopped parsley
1 lemon, juice only




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.


Rub the lamb with the olive oil, dried oregano, lemon rind, paprika, some salt and freshly ground black pepper. Thread on to 4 long or 8 short metal skewers and leave to marinate for at least 10 minutes. Preheat the grill to a hot setting.


For the salad, mix together the cucumber, tomatoes, pepper, onion, mint and oil in a large serving bowl and sprinkle over the feta and parsley. Stir in the lemon juice and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside.


Cook the lamb skewers under the grill for 5-10 minutes, or until cooked to the pinkness desired, turning occasionally. Remove from the grill and leave to rest for 2-3 minutes.


Meanwhile, wrap the pitta breads in foil and place in the oven for 5-8 minutes or until warm.


Arrange the lamb skewers on the pitta breads with the Turkish salad and serve.
