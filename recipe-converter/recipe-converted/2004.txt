This is a very seasonal Christmassy dessert using chestnuts which are traditional at this time of year, and panettone which is the classic Italian Christmas cake from Milan.

Ingredients

1 medium panettone
1 tbsp rum (optional)
450g/1lb mascarpone
285g can sweetened chestnut purée
290ml/10fl oz double cream, lightly whipped
4 tbsp icing sugar
85g/3oz dark chocolate, grated




Method


Place a 22cm/8in greased ring mould onto a baking sheet.


Cut a slice from the bottom of the panettone to line the base of the mould.


Spoon over the rum.


Process together the mascarpone and the chestnut purée. Place in a large bowl and fold in the lightly whipped cream.


Spread over the base of the panettone. Chill in the fridge.


Remove the ring by placing a hot tea towel around the edge and lifting off.


Sprinkle over the grated chocolate, sprinkle over some icing sugar, slice and serve.
