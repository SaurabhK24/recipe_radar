Jaggery is an unrefined, dark, hard sugar sold in blocks. Supermarkets have started to stock it, but it's a softer, more watery version of the real thing. Either will work, but the darker one has a more molasses-like flavour.

Ingredients

100g/3½oz jaggery (available in Asian stores and some supermarkets), chopped or pounded into smallish pieces
50g/2oz walnut halves, shells removed




Method


Place the jaggery into a small pan and heat gently, stirring frequently, until melted and smooth.


Add the walnut halves and stir to coat.


Spread the walnut halves onto a sheet of baking paper or an oiled plate, working quickly before the jaggery starts to harden - if it does, return to the heat for a few seconds until melted again. Allow to cool completely, then break into pieces.


When cold, store in an airtight container until needed. Serve as a snack or sprinkled over desserts and yoghurts.
