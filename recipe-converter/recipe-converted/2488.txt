Ingredients
For the soufflés

butter, for greasing
caster sugar, for sprinkling
3 free-range egg whites
50g/2oz icing sugar
50g/2oz dark chocolate, grated
1 orange, zest only

To serve

icing sugar, to dust
2 sprigs fresh mint
2 tbsp Greek-style yoghurt




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and place a baking sheet into the oven.


Grease two ramekins with butter and sprinkle with caster sugar.


In a large bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed. Gradually add the icing sugar, whisking between each addition, until the mixture is thick and glossy.


Gently fold the grated chocolate and the orange zest into the mixture, then spoon the mixture into the ramekins.


Place the ramekins onto the hot baking sheet. Transfer to the oven and bake for ten minutes, or until the soufflés are risen and golden-brown.


To serve, place the soufflés onto serving plates, dust with icing sugar and garnish with a sprig of mint. Serve with a dollop of yoghurt.
