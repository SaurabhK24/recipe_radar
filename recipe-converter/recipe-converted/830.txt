Ingredients

2 tbsp olive oil
½ onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, chopped
¼ aubergine, chopped
¼ courgette, chopped
½ tsp ground turmeric
100g/3½oz long grain rice
200ml/7fl oz hot water
½ vegetable stock cube
1 small ripe tomato, de-seeded and chopped
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
½ lemon, juice only




Method


Heat the oil in a pan and gently fry the onion and garlic for 3-4 minutes until soft. Add the aubergine, courgette and ground turmeric and continue to cook for a further 3-4 minutes, then stir in the rice to coat in the oil.


Dissolve the stock cube in the hot water, then pour over the rice in the pan. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook, part covered, until the rice is tender, about ten minutes.


To serve, stir in the chopped tomato, chopped parsley and lemon juice and pile onto a serving plate.
