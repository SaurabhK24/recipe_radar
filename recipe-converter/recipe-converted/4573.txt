Ingredients

1 mango
1 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp clear honey, plus 1 tbsp extra, to serve
100ml/3½fl oz double cream
1 tbsp icing sugar
1 lime, zest only
2 tbsp Greek-style yoghurt




Method


Slice the mango in half, leaving the skin on and discarding the stone in the centre.


Slice each mango half into three wedges.


Heat the olive oil in a small non-stick frying pan and fry the mango slices, cut-side down for two minutes on each side.


Drizzle over two tablespoons of honey for the last minute of frying the mango.


Arrange the mango wedges on a serving plate.


In a small bowl, whisk the cream and icing sugar together until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed.


Add the lime zest and Greek-style yoghurt to the cream and briefly whisk again to combine.


To serve, spoon the cream mixture into a small bowl and drizzle with the extra tablespoon of honey. Serve alongside the mango wedges.
