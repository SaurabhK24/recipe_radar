Ingredients
For the garlic toast

4 thick slices crusty white bread
2 tbsp olive oil
1 bulb smoked garlic, one clove removed and peeled

For the roasted pepper and herb salad

½ red pepper, seeds removed
3 tbsp olive oil
large handful fresh herbs, such as parsley, basil, dill and chives
squeeze lemon juice
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


For the garlic toast, heat a griddle pan and griddle the bread on both sides until toasted. Drizzle over half of the olive oil and rub the peeled garlic clove over the bread.


Place the rest of the bulb of garlic onto a baking sheet, drizzle with the remaining olive oil and transfer to the oven to roast for 15 minutes, or until softened.


For the roasted pepper and herb salad, place the pepper onto a baking sheet, drizzle with one tablespoon of the olive oil and roast in the oven for 15 minutes, or until softened.


Remove the pepper from the oven and place into a bowl. Cover with cling film and leave to cool slightly, then peel the skin off the pepper and roughly chop.


Place all the herbs into a bowl with the remaining olive oil and the lemon juice. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir well to coat the herbs.


To serve, place the garlic toast onto a plate along with the salad and the roasted garlic bulb to squeeze onto the toast.
