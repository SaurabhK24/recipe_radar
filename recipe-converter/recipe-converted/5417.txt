Enjoy a classic key lime pie topped with zingy sugar-coated lime zest






By Emma Crowhurst






Ingredients

375g/12oz plain or sweetmeal digestive biscuits, crushed
150g/5oz unsalted butter
grated zest and juice of 8 large limes
570ml/1 pint double cream
1 x 397g/14oz can sweetened condensed milk
crystalised lime zest, to decorate




Method


Melt the butter in a small pan and stir in the crushed biscuits. Lightly press into the base of a 23cm/9in deep loosed-bottomed fluted flan tin. Chill whilst preparing the filling.


To prepare the filling: place the lime juice into a large bowl, add the cream and condensed milk. Whisk for 1-2 minutes. Add the lime zest and lightly stir. Pour onto the prepared biscuit base. Place onto a tray and chill in the fridge for 1-2 hours.


Decorate with crystalized lime zest and serve.




Recipe Tips
To make the crystalized lime zest, wash and dry 2 whole limes and peel with a vegetable peeler. Using a sharp knife cut the peel into thin matchstick-sized strips. Blanch in boiling water for 1 minute. Drain and refresh in cold water. Place 50g/2oz caster or granulated sugar into a small pan with enough boiling water to cover. Bring to the boil and heat until it reaches 180C/350F, use a sugar thermometer to test the temperature. Add the lime zest and remove from the heat. Stir well and pour into a metal sieve over a bowl. As the sugar cools separate the lime zest with a fork and allow to cool completely. When cool remove the lime zest from the sieve and rub off the excess hard sugar. Use as required in the key lime pie recipe.
