For a top holiday project, these little spinach and cheese savoury bites are great for cooking with children.



Ingredients

vegetable oil for greasing
1 free-range egg
1 tbsp polenta (quick cook)
1 large handful baby spinach
100g/3½oz plain cottage cheese
pinch mild chilli powder
45g/2oz plain flour
ground black pepper




Method


First wash your hands and put on an apron. Weigh and measure all the ingredients. Ask a grown-up to preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 5. Oil a mini-muffin tray using the pastry brush and vegetable oil.


Break the egg into a bowl and beat it with the fork, then add the polenta. This allows the polenta to soften slightly before cooking.


Ask a grown-up to help you to snip the spinach leaves into small pieces using scissors.


Add the cottage cheese, chilli powder and black pepper to the mixing bowl. Then stir in the egg and polenta mixture. Sprinkle the plain flour over the mixture and stir again until it is thoroughly combined


Divide the mixture equally between the six parts of the muffin tin. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until they are brown on top. Leave to cool. Serve one or two of these little savoury cakes with ham.
