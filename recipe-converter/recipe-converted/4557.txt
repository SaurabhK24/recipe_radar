Ingredients
For the pork chops

4 pork chops
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp vegetable oil

For the Thai red cabbage

1½ limes, juice only
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1 tbsp finely grated galangal
1 tbsp finely grated fresh root ginger
3 tbsp Thai fish sauce
2 green birds’-eye chillies, finely chopped
2 tbsp palm sugar
4 tbsp roasted salted peanuts
large bunch holy basil, leaves picked
3 tbsp shredded mint leaves
1 red cabbage, finely sliced




Method


For the pork chops, preheat the oven to 220C/450F/Gas 7.


Heat a griddle pan until hot and oil and season the pork chops with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Place the pork chops onto the griddle pan and cook either side until bar marks appear.


Transfer to the oven to cook for 3-7 minutes (until cooked through) – the time will depend on the thickness of the chop.


For the Thai red cabbage, place all the ingredients except the cabbage in a pestle and mortar and pound to make a chunky paste.


Place the sliced red cabbage in a large bowl and tip the paste over the cabbage. Lightly mix.


To serve, divide the cabbage among four serving plates and lean the pork chop up against it.
