Ingredients
For the tart

flour, for dusting
about 275g/10oz readymade all-butter puff pastry
500g/1lb 2oz white marzipan
500g/1lb 2oz plums, cut in half, stones removed, then each half cut in half again
light muscovado sugar, to taste
1 free-range egg, lightly beaten

For the orange mascarpone

250g/9oz mascarpone
1 small orange, grated zest and juice only
1 tbsp orange flower water
25g/1oz icing sugar




Method


For the tart, preheat the oven to 200C/ 400F/gas 6. Line a square or rectangular baking tray with parchment paper.


On a lightly floured work surface, roll the pastry to a 0.5cm/⅛in thickness. Use the rolling pin to lift it onto the baking tray and trim to fit.


Roll out the marzipan so that it will sit on top of the pastry leaving a 3cm/1in clear border of pastry all the way round, then place it on top of the pastry.


Dot the plums on top of the marzipan, then sprinkle with the sugar (how much you use will depend on the sweetness of the plums; remember the marzipan is very sweet).


Brush the pastry border with the beaten egg then bake in the oven for about 20 minutes, or until the pastry is puffed up and golden-brown and the marzipan is nice and gooey.


Meanwhile, for the orange mascarpone, beat all the orange mascarpone ingredients together.


Serve slices of the hot tart with the cold mascarpone cream.




Recipe Tips
Try using apricots, nectarines, peaches or figs instead of plums when they're in season. A good quality vanilla ice cream can be served with it instead of the orange mascarpone to save time.
