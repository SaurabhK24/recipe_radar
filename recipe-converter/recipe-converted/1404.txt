Ingredients

400ml/14fl oz dairy-free milk or apple juice
125g/4½oz buckwheat flour
40g/1½oz gram flour
1 tbsp cornflour
pinch salt
200g/7oz soya or regular cream cheese
1 lemon, juice and zest
rapeseed oil, for frying
200g/7oz smoked salmon
small bunch of chives, chopped
25g/1oz pumpkin seeds, toasted
1 tbsp caperberries, roughly chopped




Method


Whisk together the dairy-free milk, flours, salt and 65ml/2¼fl oz water in a large bowl. Leave the mixture to rest for at least 1 hour.


Meanwhile, mix the cream cheese, lemon juice and lemon zest together in a bowl. Beat until smooth and creamy then store in the fridge until ready to use.


Heat a 20-25cm/8-10in non-stick frying pan over a medium heat until hot. Brush lightly with oil and pour in a little of the batter, swirling it around so that it forms a thin layer on the bottom of the pan. If the batter isn’t thin enough you can add a little more liquid to the mixture.


When the top of the pancake is dry (about 1 minute) flip the pancake and cook the other side for a further minute, the pancakes should colour just slightly. Repeat with the remaining batter. You can keep the cooked pancakes warm by wrapping in foil and placing in a low temperature oven.


Spread a generous layer of cream cheese over the pancake and top with a slice of smoked salmon, chives, pumpkin seeds and caperberries. Roll the pancake to enclose the filling and serve.




Recipe Tips
You can make the batter the night before so that it is ready to use in the morning.
