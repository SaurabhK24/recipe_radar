Ingredients
For the sea bass

1 fillet sea bass, skinned
100g/3½oz cornflour
1 tsp salt, plus extra for sprinkling
5 tbsp sparkling water
300ml/½ pint vegetable oil, for deep frying

For the salsa

¼ pineapple, peeled and chopped
pinch chilli flakes
1 lime, zest and juice
55g/2oz green beans, cooked and chopped




Method


For the crisp fried sea bass, slice the fish in half on the diagonal. Place the cornflour, salt and water into a bowl and whisk together to make a thick batter.


Place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Don't leave unattended.)


Dip the sea bass into the batter to coat, shaking off any excess, then carefully place into the hot oil. Deep fry until crisp and golden-brown. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Sprinkle with salt.


For the salsa, place all the salsa ingredients into a bowl and mix well.


To serve, place the crisp fried sea bass onto a plate with a dollop of salsa.
