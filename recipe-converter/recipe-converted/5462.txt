Ingredients
For the baked rolled sole

1 sole fillet, skinned and sliced in half lengthways
30g/1oz butter, cut into pieces, plus extra for greasing
½ lemon, juice only
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the white wine and dill sauce

2 tbsp white wine
4 tbsp double cream
1 tsp Dijon mustard
½ lemon, juice only
handful fresh dill, chopped




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the baked rolled sole, grease a small ovenproof dish and place the strips of sole into the dish. Roll the sole pieces up and dot with the butter. Squeeze over the lemon juice and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Transfer the dish to the oven and bake for 6-8 minutes, or until cooked through.


For the white wine and dill sauce, place the white wine into a small saucepan, bring to the boil and simmer until the volume is reduced by half.


Add the cream and simmer until the sauce is slightly thickened. Stir in the mustard, lemon juice and dill.


To serve, place the baked rolled sole onto a serving plate and drizzle over the sauce.
