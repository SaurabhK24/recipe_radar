This lightly spiced carrot soup couldn't be any simpler to make, yet it makes a delicious supper on a cold winter's evening.

Ingredients

150g/5½oz unsalted butter
150g/5½oz onions, chopped
2 garlic cloves, crushed
500g/1lb 2oz carrots, peeled and chopped into small pieces
1 tsp cumin seeds
½ tsp Madras curry powder
300ml/½ pint chicken stock (or vegetable stock)
1 bouquet garni
1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander, to serve




Method


Melt the butter in a saucepan and sweat the onion, garlic and carrots, with a pinch of salt, for 5-6 minutes, or until softened.


Meanwhile toast the cumin seeds in a dry frying pan until fragrant. Add the toasted cumin seeds and Madras curry powder to the vegetables and cook a further 2-3 minutes.


Add the stock, bouquet garni and 500ml/18fl oz water and bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes.


Remove the bouquet garni, then blend the soup in a blender until smooth. Pass through a sieve into a clean saucepan and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, ladle the soup in serving bowls and sprinkle with chopped fresh coriander.
