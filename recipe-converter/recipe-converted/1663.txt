Method


For the compote, put the apples, vanilla, butter, cinnamon, sugar and water in pan and cook, stirring often, until ingredients turn into a purée.


Then mix in the sultanas and set aside.


For the diamond, roll out the puff pastry and cut two 10cm/4in wide diamonds.


Cut around the edges of the diamonds and fold the corners back on each other.


Brush with egg wash, sprinkle with sugar and bake at 180C/350F/Gas 4 until golden brown. Leave to cool.


Slice the diamonds in half, spoon the purée over the bottom, add the pastry lids and serve with clotted cream.
