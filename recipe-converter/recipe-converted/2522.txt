Ingredients
For the scones

225g/8oz self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting
½ tsp salt
55g/2oz cold butter, chopped
30g/1oz caster sugar
50g/2oz dark chocolate, chopped
150ml/¼ pint milk
1 free-range egg, beaten

For the orange mascarpone cream

150g/5½oz mascarpone
1 tbsp icing sugar
½ orange, juice and zest




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/425F/Gas 7.


Place the flour, salt, butter and sugar into a food processor and pulse until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.


Add the chocolate and milk and blend until the mixture is well combined and comes together as a dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, knead lightly then pat down to 2.5cm/1in thick. Cut out six rounds using a pastry cutter, then place onto a non-stick baking sheet. Brush the tops of the scones with beaten egg.


Transfer to the oven and bake for 15 minutes, or until the scones are well risen and golden-brown. Leave to cool.


For the orange mascarpone cream, mix the mascarpone, icing sugar and orange juice and zest together in a bowl.


To serve, place the scones onto a serving plate with the bowl of orange mascarpone cream alongside.
