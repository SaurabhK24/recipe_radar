Ingredients

1kg/2¼lb small new potatoes, scrubbed
1 medium onion, finely chopped
mayonnaise
mango chutney (approximately half the amount of mayonnaise)
handful fresh mint, chopped
handful fresh parsley, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Cook the potatoes in a pan of boiling salted water until tender, drain and leave to cool.


In a large serving dish mix together the onion, mayonnaise, chutney and half the mint and half of the parsley. Mix well and season with salt and pepper to taste.


Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, slice them in half. Depending on the size of potatoes, I like to cut some into halves and some into quarters rather than all uniform size.


Mix the potatoes into the mayonnaise and onion mix. Stir well and sprinkle over the remaining mint and parsley.


Check for seasoning and get stuck in!
