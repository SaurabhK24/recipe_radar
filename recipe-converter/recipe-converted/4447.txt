If you’re looking for the perfect roast potatoes, look no further than this recipe which creates deliciously fluffy potatoes on the inside and plenty of crunch on the outside.






By Tim Maddams






Ingredients

1.5kg/3lb 5oz King Edward or Maris Piper potatoes
1 sprig rosemary
1 sprig thyme
5-6 garlic cloves, roughly bashed
1 bay leaf
½ tbsp whole black peppercorns
6 tbsp goose fat
sea salt




Method


Peel and halve the potatoes (quarter any large ones; the pieces should all be around the same size). Put the potatoes into a large saucepan along with the rosemary, garlic, bay and peppercorns. Cover with cold water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat slightly and simmer for 5-7 minutes.


Drain the potatoes and leave in the colander to steam dry for 5-10 minutes.


Meanwhile preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7. Put the goose fat into a large roasting tin and put in the oven for 3-5 minutes, or until very hot.


Carefully tip the potatoes (as well as the aromatics they were boiled with) into the hot goose fat, shake gently to move around and roast for 35-40 minutes, turning once or twice.


After 20 minutes in the oven remove and gently squash the potatoes a little to create more surface area to make them extra crisp. Return to the oven and cook for a further 15-20 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown.


Discard the aromatics and then season the potatoes with salt. Serve.
