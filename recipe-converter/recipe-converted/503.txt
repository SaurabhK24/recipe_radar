Ingredients

tomatoes
water, for boiling
iced water, for cooling




Method


With a paring knife, score the tomatoes with an X at the opposite end to where the stern was once attached.


Immerse tomatoes in boiling water for 10 seconds or until they start to blister.


Plunge them into iced water immediately until cold.


Peel off the skin and cut in half cross-ways.


Hold the tomato halves cut side down and squeeze to rid them of their seeds and water.


Dice to the required size ready for further use.
