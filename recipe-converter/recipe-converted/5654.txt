Heat the oil in a saucepan and fry the potato and garlic for 3-4 minutes, to soften.


Add the leeks and cook for a further few minutes.


Stir in the wine with the stock and cream then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 10-12 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.


Using a hand blender, blend the soup until smooth and season to taste.
