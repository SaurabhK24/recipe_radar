Ingredients

1 big beef tomato
salt and freshly ground black pepper
dash olive oil
3 slices prosciutto
2 slices sourdough bread
3 free-range eggs
50ml/2fl oz cream
knob of butter




Method


Preheat the griddle to hot. Slice the tomato in half, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, drizzle with oil and place on a grill pan with the prosciutto. Grill until the tomato is softened and the prosciutto is crisp.


Lightly toast the sourdough bread.


Crack the eggs into a bowl. Season them with salt and pepper and beat well. Beat in the cream.


Pour the mixture into a non-stick pan and cook the scrambled eggs until they reach a sloppy consistency. Remove from the heat.


Pour the scrambled eggs onto the sourdough toast and place the grilled prosciutto on top. Arrange the grilled tomatoes on the side and serve.
