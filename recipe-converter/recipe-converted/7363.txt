Ingredients

vegetable oil, to deep-fry
150g/5oz self-raising flour
1 tsp baking powder
50ml/2fl oz cream
100g/4oz frozen peas, defrosted
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Heat a deep, heavy-bottomed pan, one-third filled with vegetable oil, until a breadcrumb will sizzle gently in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous! Do not leave unattended.)


Meanwhile place the flour and baking powder into a bowl. Add the cream and whisk well to make a thick batter.


Add the peas and stir through. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Carefully place spoonfuls of the batter into the hot oil and cook for 1-2 minutes, until golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper and serve warm.
