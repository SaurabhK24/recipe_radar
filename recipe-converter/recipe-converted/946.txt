Add brandy or rum depending on personal preference or what you have available - they're both delicious.





By Deborah Reddihough






Ingredients

55g/2oz butter
55g/2oz plain flour
570ml/1 pint milk
4 tbsp brandy or dark rum
55g/2oz caster sugar




Method


Melt the butter and stir in the flour. Cook for 2 minutes and then stir in the milk. Bring to the boil, stirring all the time, and simmer gently for 10 minutes.


Stir in the brandy (or rum) and the sugar and serve with Christmas pudding.




Recipe Tips
You can make this using cornflour instead of making a roux, but the results aren't as creamy.
