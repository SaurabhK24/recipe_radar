Ingredients
For the soup

1 tbsp olive oil
½ onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
100ml/3½fl oz white wine
8 asparagus spears, chopped
55g/2oz chanterelle mushrooms
400ml/14fl oz chicken or vegetable stock
100ml/3½fl oz cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the balsamic caramelised tomatoes

1 tbsp olive oil
1 tomato, halved
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar

To serve

1 tbsp Greek-style yoghurt
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the soup, heat the oil in a pan and gently fry the onion and garlic for 2-3 minutes.


Add the white wine and simmer for 2-3 minutes, then add the asparagus and mushrooms and cook for 3-4 minutes.


Add the stock and simmer until the asparagus stems are tender, about five minutes. Stir in the cream and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Using a hand-held blender, blend until smooth.


For the balsamic tomatoes, heat the oil in an ovenproof pan and fry the tomato halves for about a minute. Pour over the vinegar and place in the oven to roast for about 7-8 minutes.


To serve, place the two halves of tomato on top of each other in a shallow soup bowl and pour the soup around the edges. Top the tomato with the yoghurt and fresh chives and serve.
