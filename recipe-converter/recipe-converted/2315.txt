Ingredients

2 tbsp sunflower oil
2 tbsp lime juice
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped
300g/10½oz pork fillet, cubed
200g/7oz Thai fragrant rice
6 spring onions, thinly sliced
200g/7oz pineapple, peeled and diced
½ red onion, cut into wedges
1 lime, cut into wedges
ready-made sweet chilli sauce, to serve

Method


Soak 8 wooden skewers in warm water.


Mix together the oil, lime juice, garlic, chilli with a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl, add the pork and stir to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.


Meanwhile, cook the rice in lightly salted boiling water for 12-15 minutes, until soft. Drain and stir through the spring onions and pineapple.


Preheat the grill to a hot setting.


Thread the pork on to the skewers, alternating it with onion and lime wedges, and cook under the grill for about 10 minutes, turning frequently and basting with the remaining marinade, until the pork is cooked through.


Place the skewers and rice on a plate with the sweet chilli sauce and serve.
