3 tbsp caster sugar
1 red bird's eye chilli, chopped

Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Cut the mango in half. With a knife score a grid pattern into the mango, but not piercing through the skin. Turn the mango inside out to make a hedgehog shape. Place the mango onto a baking sheet and drizzle with the lime juice.
