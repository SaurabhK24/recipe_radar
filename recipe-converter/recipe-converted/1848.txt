This is so easy - don't tell anyone. A jar of salted caramel makes a great Christmas present. If you don’t want the rum, just leave it out. It still tastes amazing.

  You will need to have sterilised jars to keep the caramel in. This recipe makes about 2 jam jars of caramel.

Ingredients

400g tin readymade condensed milk caramel
100g/3½oz unsalted butter
½ tsp salt
3 tbsp rum (optional)




Method


First sterilise the jam jars. Wash the jars in soapy water and rinse in clean warm water. Allow them to drip-dry, upside down, on a rack in the oven set to 140C/120C Fan/Gas 1. Leave them there for at least half an hour while you make the salted caramel.


Heat the condensed milk caramel, butter and 8 tbsp of water in a pan and bring to a simmer. Stir until the caramel dissolves. Add the salt and the rum (if using), mix, then leave to cool slightly.


Pour into a sterilised jar. This will keep in the fridge for 1 week … if you can make it last that long.
