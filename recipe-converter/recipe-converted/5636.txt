Salty feta combines brilliantly with bitter leaves and fresh, slighly sour, pomegranate. A salad to impress.



Ingredients

200g/7oz feta
splash lemon juice
1-2 garlic cloves, crushed
100g/3½oz flaked almonds, toasted
120g bag mixed rocket, spinach and watercress
3 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 pomegranates, seeds only




Method


Put the feta in a shallow dish, squeeze over the lemon juice and scatter over the garlic. Leave to marinate while you prepare the rest of the salad.


Toast the almonds under a medium grill until lightly browned, then leave to cool. Cut the pomegranate in half and pop the seeds out into a bowl by bashing the skin with a spoon.


Toss together the rocket, spinach and watercress in a large salad bowl with the olive oil, and salt and freshly ground pepper. Crumble in the marinated feta, and scatter the pomegranate seeds and toasted almonds over. Serve immediately.
