10g/3½oz cheddar cheese
50g/2oz pickled green jalapeno chillies
20 salted corn tortilla chips

Method


Heat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Coarsely grate the cheddar cheese and finely slice the jalapeno chillies.


Lay out the unbroken corn chips on a baking tray, and top each one with a little grated cheese and two slices of jalapeno chilli.


Bake for 5-10 minutes or until the cheese melts and the corn chips are hot and crisp.
