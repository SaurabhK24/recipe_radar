Ingredients

350g/12oz jasmine rice, rinsed until the water runs clear
600ml/1 pint boiling water




Method


Place the rice into a heavy-based saucepan and add the boiling water. Bring to the boil and then cover with a tight-fitting lid and reduce to a low heat. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until all of the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender.


Uncover the pan and remove from the heat. Fluff up the rice grains with a fork and serve immediately.
