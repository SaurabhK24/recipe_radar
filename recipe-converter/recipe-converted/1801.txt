Ingredients
For the prawns

3 raw tiger rawns, shelled but heads and tails left on
1 lime, half cut into wedges, half juiced
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp honey
1 tbsp sesame seeds

For the broccoli

Â½ head broccoli, cut into florets and cooked
1 pinch chilli flakes
2 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Soak a wooden skewer in cold water for 10-15 minutes. Drain.


For the prawns, thread the prawns onto the skewer, alternating with two wedges of lime. Heat a chargrill pan until smoking and grill the skewers for 1-2 minutes, then turn over. Sprinkle the lime juice, soy sauce, honey and sesame seeds over the prawns and cook for a further 1-2 minutes, or until the prawns are pink and cooked through.


For the broccoli, toss the broccoli with the chilli flakes and oil, and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, spoon the broccoli arrabiata onto a serving plate and top with the prawn skewer.
