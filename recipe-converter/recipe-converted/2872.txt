Ingredients

340g/12oz unrefined sugar
570ml/1 pint water
40 coffee beans
180g/6oz cocoa powder
pinch of salt
60g/2oz of the best quality bitter chocolate you can find




Method


Place the sugar in a pan over a medium heat. Brush the sides of the pan with a pastry brush dipped in a mug of cold water. Continue this process until the sugar caramelises. (You will probably end up using a third of the water).


Add the rest of the water, coffee beans, cocoa powder, salt and chocolate.


Bring to the boil.


Pass through a very fine sieve and allow to cool.


Serve cold.
