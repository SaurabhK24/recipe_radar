Ingredients

450g/1lb fresh white fish fillets such as sole or plaice
cornflour, for dusting
150ml/5fl oz groundnut oil

For the hot and sour sauce

150ml/5 fl oz chicken stock
2 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
1½ tbsp dark soy sauce
2 tbsp chilli bean sauce (available from Asian grocers)
½ tsp freshly ground white pepper
2 tbsp Chinese black rice vinegar or cider vinegar
2 tsp sugar

For the garnish

3 tbsp finely chopped spring onions




Method


Remove the skin from the fish. Cut the fillet across the width and at a slight diagonal into 2.5cm (1in) wide strips. Dust the pieces with cornflour, shaking off any excess.


Heat a wok until it is very hot. Add the oil and fry the fish strips gently for 2-3 minutes until golden brown.


Drain the cooked fish strips on kitchen paper.


Pour off all the oil. Wipe the wok and reheat. Add all the hot and sour sauce ingredients, bring to a boil then simmer.


Add the fish strips and simmer in the sauce for two minutes.


Serve on a warm platter garnished with spring onions.
