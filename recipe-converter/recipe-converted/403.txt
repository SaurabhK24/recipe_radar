150g/5½oz long grain rice

For the spicy rice, heat the oil in a medium pan, add all the spices and the sesame seeds and cook gently for 1-2 minutes.


Add the rice and stir well to coat all the grains.


Add the chicken stock, bring to the boil and boil for 8-10 minutes, or until the rice is tender.


Lightly grease two cups or timbales with the vegetable oil and press the rice into them. Turn the rice out onto serving plates.


For the dressing, heat the olive oil in a small pan over a medium heat and fry the red pepper for 3-4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for a further minute. Add the water, wine and sugar, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and simmer for 3-4 minutes. Add the parsley, then blend the mixture with a hand blender until almost smooth.
