These small almond cakes are flavoured with raspberry and basil - an unusual and fresh summery combination.

  Equipment: you need a set of 12 silicone financier moulds and a piping bag for this recipe.

Ingredients

40g/1½oz plain flour, sifted
¼ tsp baking powder
120g/4¼oz icing sugar, sifted, plus extra for dusting
45g/1½oz ground almonds
4 free-range eggs, whites only
65g/2¼oz butter
12 basil leaves, finely shredded
12 - 24 raspberries, cut in half




Method


Preheat the oven to 170C/350F/Gas 4. Grease the financier moulds and set onto a baking tray.


Sift the flour and baking powder into a bowl. Add the icing sugar and ground almonds and stir to mix.


Add the egg whites and whisk everything thoroughly for one minute with a wire whisk.


Heat the butter in a small pan until the solids just start to brown. Tip the butter into the financier mix through a tea strainer.


Add the finely shredded basil leaves.


Leave the mixture to rest for 5-10 minutes.


Transfer the mixture to a piping bag fitted with a 1cm/½in plain nozzle.


Pipe into the silicone financier moulds, filling them three-quarters full.


Place two raspberries (if small) or one (if large) cut into two halves into the basil financiers.


Bake for 10-12 minutes until just golden-brown (may need up to 15 minutes to cook).


Remove from the oven and leave the baked financiers in their moulds for 1-2 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to finish cooling.


When cooled, lightly dust the financiers with sifted icing sugar.
