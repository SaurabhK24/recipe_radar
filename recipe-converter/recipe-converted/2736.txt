Ingredients
For the citrus sponge

150g/5½oz caster sugar
150g/5½oz butter, plus extra for greasing
150g/5½oz self-raising flour
½ tsp baking powder
3 free-range eggs
1 lemon, zest only

For the apricot cardamom syrup

100g/3½oz caster sugar
100ml/3½fl oz white wine
4 cardamom pods, lightly crushed
1 vanilla pod, split
55g/3oz dried apricots




Method


For the citrus sponge, place the sugar and butter into a food processor and blend until combined.


Add the flour and baking powder and blend again.


Add the eggs and lemon zest and blend until smooth.


Spoon equal quantities of the cake batter into two greased microwave-safe ramekins (to half-fill) and cover with cling film before microwaving at full power for 3½ minutes, or until risen and cooked through.


For the syrup, place the sugar and wine into a small pan over a medium heat and bring to the boil.


Add the cardamom, vanilla pod and apricots and reduce the heat to simmer for 5-6 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced and is slightly syrupy.


To serve, turn the sponges out onto serving plates. Spoon the apricots and syrup over the sponges.
