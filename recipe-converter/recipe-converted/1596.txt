Ingredients
For the tart

1 x 7½cm/3in square ready-made puff pastry
150g/5½oz mincemeat
1 cooking apple (such as Bramley apple), cored, peeled and sliced
2 tbsp soft brown sugar
1 tbsp milk

For the mint cream

1 tbsp chopped fresh mint
2 tbsp icing sugar
100ml/3½fl oz double cream, whipped to soft peaks

To serve

1 tbsp crushed walnuts
3 tbsp clear honey
icing sugar, for dusting




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Mark 6.


For the tart, lay the pastry on a baking sheet and spread the mincemeat onto the pastry, leaving a 1cm/½in border. Place the apples and sugar on top of the mincemeat.


Brush the pastry edges with milk and bake for eight minutes, or until golden-brown.


To make the mint cream, stir together the mint and sugar with the whipped cream in a small bowl.


Sprinkle the tart with walnuts, drizzle with honey and dust with icing sugar. Serve the tart warm.
