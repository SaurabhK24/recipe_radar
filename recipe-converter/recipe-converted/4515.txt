Ingredients

1½ leaves gelatine
150ml/¼ pint milk
150ml/¼ pint double cream
600ml/1 pint organic Greek yoghurt
6 tbsp heather honey
12 fresh figs, quartered




Method


Place the gelatine into a bowl of iced water and leave to soften for five minutes. Pour the milk and cream into a small pan and bring to the boil.


Remove the softened gelatine from the iced water, gently squeeze out the excess water and stir into the milk and cream. Remove from the heat and stir until the gelatine has dissolved.


Pour this mixture through a fine sieve (to remove any lumps) into a small bowl. To start chilling the mixture and to allow it to start setting, fill a larger bowl with iced water and place the small bowl inside in it.


When the mixture starts to thicken slightly, pour in the Greek yoghurt and stir until completely combined and smooth.


Pour the mixture into four panna cotta moulds (2cm/½in deep x 10cm/4in wide), cover with cling film, place in the fridge and leave to set for at least three hours.


Heat the honey in a pan over a medium heat. When the honey starts to boil rapidly, add the figs and cook for two minutes, stirring a couple of times.


To serve the panna cotta, dip each mould into a little hot water, preferably from a just boiled kettle, for 2-3 seconds. Turn out onto four serving plates. Spoon the figs and hot honey around the panna cotta and serve.
