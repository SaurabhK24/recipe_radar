If you haven't had teriyaki before, you'll be delighted with the flavour. Salty and slightly sweet, it's great for all the family.

Ingredients

4 chicken thighs
30ml/2 tbsp honey
60ml/4 tbsp soy sauce
60ml/4 tbsp mirin
30ml/2 tbsp sake
2 tsp grated fresh root ginger
1 garlic clove, chopped
30ml/2 tbsp vegetable oil
250g/9oz medium egg noodles




Method


Remove the bones from the chicken thighs using a small, sharp knife.


In a large bowl, mix together the honey, soy sauce, mirin, sake, ginger and garlic.


Place the chicken thighs in the marinade and cover the meat thoroughly with the sauce. Transfer the chicken to the fridge for 15 minutes.


When ready to cook the chicken, heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan. Dry the skin side of the chicken thighs on some kitchen paper, so the skin will crisp up when fried. Place the chicken thighs in the frying pan, skin side down, over a medium heat. Fry until the skin is browned. Depending on the size of your frying pan, you may need to fry the chicken in batches - don't crowd the pan.


Turn down the heat to low, then turn the chicken over to fry the other side. Pour the sauce used to marinate the chicken into the pan. Simmer on a low heat for five minutes, then increase the temperature and cook until the sauce becomes thick.


Meanwhile, cook the noodles according to packet instructions.


To serve, slice the chicken and place on a plate with the noodles. Pour the thickened teriyaki sauce over the chicken.




Recipe Tips
Chicken thighs are full of flavour and the meat is more tender than chicken breast.
  De-boning is very simple â€“ use a small knife and just a little patience!
  Buying chicken thighs with the bone in is cheaper!
