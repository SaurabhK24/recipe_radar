Ingredients

1kg/2Â¼lb pork ribs, cut into 5cm/2in-thick ribs
50ml/2fl oz olive oil
1 onion, peeled, finely chopped
1 carrot, peeled, thinly sliced
1 stick celery, finely chopped
300ml/10fl oz red wine
250ml/9fl oz chicken stock
250ml/9fl oz passata
2 salted anchovy fillets
2 sprigs fresh rosemary
crusty bread, to serve




Method


Parboil the ribs in a pan of water for 20-25 minutes, or until tender. Drain well and pat dry with kitchen paper. Set aside to cool.


Meanwhile, heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion, carrot and celery and fry for 6-8 minutes, or until softened.


Add the wine, chicken stock, passata, anchovies and rosemary sprigs, stir well and bring the mixture to the boil.


Add the ribs, then reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering. Simmer for 45-90 minutes, checking regularly, or until the meat is tender and falling off the bone. (NB: Add a little water to the pan during cooking if it starts to dry out.)


To serve, divide the ribs equally among six serving plates. Spoon over the red wine sauce. Serve with crusty bread.
