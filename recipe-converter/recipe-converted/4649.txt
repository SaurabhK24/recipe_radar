Ingredients

½ chicken breast, skinless
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp chopped chervil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
100g/3&frac12oz purple sprouting broccoli
½ lemon, juice only
sprig fresh dill, to garnish




Method


Using a meat tenderiser or the base of a heavy saucepan, put the chicken breast on a chopping board and flatten out to 1cm/½in thickness.


Place the chicken in a small glass bowl with one tablespoon of the olive oil and the chervil. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Bring a pot of salted water to the boil, add the broccoli and cook for one minute. Drain and immediately rinse under cold water. When it has cooled, drain again and dry off with kitchen towel.


Heat a griddle pan until hot. Place the chicken on the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until cooked through.


Toss the broccoli in the remaining one tablespoon of olive oil and place in the hot griddle pan. Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until tender.


To serve, arrange the broccoli on a plate and top with the chicken. Squeeze over the lemon juice and garnish with dill.
