Warm up any occasion with a little mulled cider. Brilliant to make for after a chilly weekend walk.

Ingredients

200ml fresh apple juice
1 heaped tbsp muscovado sugar
half an orange studded with 3-4 cloves
1 cinnamon stick
500ml cider
50ml orange liqueur
1 lemon and ginger herbal tea bag




Method


Put the apple juice and sugar into a pan and stir. Warm together until the sugar is dissolved. Add the cinnamon stick and the half orange studded with cloves. Add the cider and orange liqueur and warm gently


Put in the lemon and ginger teabag and leave to infuse for 2 minutes and then remove. Warm, do not boil, for 10 min so that all flavours infuse. Serve warm. If pre-preparing, remove spices and fruit and keep warm.




Recipe Tips
Replace the cider with more apple juice and leave out the orange liqueur for a family-friendly treat.
