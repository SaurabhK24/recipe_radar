Ingredients
For the cinnamon-roasted apple

30g/1oz butter
½ apple, cored
1 tbsp white wine
¼ tsp ground cinnamon
1 tbsp icing sugar

For the butterscotch sauce

100g/3½oz caster sugar
55g/2oz butter
4 tbsp double cream
1 tbsp water




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the cinnamon-roasted apple, heat the butter in a small ovenproof frying pan and fry the apple cut-side down until golden-brown.


Add the white wine and simmer for one minute. Sprinkle over the cinnamon and icing sugar.


Transfer to the oven and bake for ten minutes, or until softened.


For the butterscotch sauce, heat the caster sugar in a non-stick frying pan until it turns a deep caramel colour.


Remove from the heat, add the butter, cream and water and whisk to make a thick, smooth sauce.


To serve, place the apple onto a serving plate and drizzle with the sauce.
