Three minutes to cook, a lifetime to master - the poached egg makes a great breakfast or welcome addition to a light supper.



Ingredients

1 tbsp white wine vinegar
2 free-range eggs
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Fill a small pan just over one third full with cold water and bring it to the boil.


Add the vinegar and turn down to simmer.


Crack the eggs one at a time into a small bowl and gently tip into the simmering water.


Lightly poach for 3-4 minutes.


Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towels.


Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and serve immediately.
