By Nigel Slater


From Nigel Slater's Dish of the Day






Ingredients

30g/1oz butter
1 red onion, peeled and sliced
6 chicken thighs
6 rashers of smoked streaky bacon, cut into postage stamp sized pieces
2 Discovery apples or similar, cored and sliced into wedges
300ml/10Â½fl oz dry cider
salt
mashed potato, to serve




Method


Place the butter in a heavy-based, lidded casserole over a medium heat.


Add the sliced onion and allow to soften for one minute.


Place the chicken thighs, skin-side down, into the pan and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until the skin begins to brown.


Add the sliced bacon, turn the thighs over, and cook for a further 2-3 minutes, or until the bacon begins to colour.


Add the apples and allow to soften for one minute.


Pour in the cider and season with a pinch of salt. Cover with a lid and simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken juices run clear.


Serve immediately, taking the pot to the table and allowing people to help themselves.
