Ingredients
For the salad

150g/5½oz green beans, trimmed
1 tbsp olive oil
1 garlic clove, crushed
½ onion, finely sliced
¼ tsp caster sugar
½ tsp chilli flakes

For the oriental lamb cutlets

2 lamb cutlets
½ tsp chilli flakes
2 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp clear honey
½ lime, juice only
½ orange, juice only
sprig fresh chervil, to garnish




Method


For the salad, bring a pan of salted water to the boil and blanch the green beans for two minutes. Drain.


Heat the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan and add the garlic, onion, sugar and chilli flakes and sauté until the onion is soft but not coloured.


Add the drained green beans to the pan and fry for a further one minute. Set aside to keep warm.


For the oriental lamb cutlets, heat a small non-stick frying pan and place the lamb cutlets, fat-side down, into the pan until the fat has melted and is crisp and golden-brown. Turn the lamb cutlets over and brown on the other side, until the lamb is almost cooked through.


Add the remaining ingredients to the pan, stir well, and fry the lamb for a further two minutes on each side until the juices have reduced to half the volume.


To serve, place the lamb cutlets on a bed of the warm beans and garnish with chervil.
