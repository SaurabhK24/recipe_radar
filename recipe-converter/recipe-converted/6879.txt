Ingredients

8 ready-made waffles
2 tbsp maple syrup
1 tsp ground cinnamon
100g/3½oz butter
100g/3½ oz sugar
2 oranges
3 tbsp brandy
150ml/¼ pint double cream, to serve




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Place the waffles on a baking sheet. Pour over the maple syrup and sprinkle with cinnamon. Place in the oven to warm through for about five minutes.


Heat the butter in a frying pan. Add the sugar and cook over a low heat until the sugar begins to caramelise.


Zest one orange and add to the sugar in the pan. Peel and segment both oranges and add to the pan. Pour in the brandy and carefully flambé the oranges.


Whip the double cream until soft peaks form. Arrange the warm waffles on a large platter. Spoon over the oranges and brandy sauce. Serve with the whipped cream.
