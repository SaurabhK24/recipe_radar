Ingredients
For the filling

450g/1lb cooking apples, peeled, cored and sliced
15g/1/2oz butter
85g/3oz sugar
½ lemon, juice and zest

For the topping

115g/4oz flour
pinch salt
½ tsp baking powder
55g/2oz butter, softened
55g/2oz sugar
1 free-range egg
1 tbsp milk




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the filling, place the apples, butter, sugar and lemon juice and zest in a saucepan with a little water and cook gently until the apples have softened.


Put the apple mixture in the bottom of a pie dish, packing the apples down to provide a firm base for the topping (this helps it rise evenly during baking).


For the topping, sieve the flour together with a pinch of salt and the baking powder. In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and sugar, beat in the egg and then lightly fold in the flour. Add a little milk if the mixture is too stiff.


Pour the mixture on top of the apples and bake in the oven for 45-55 minutes or until the top is golden-brown and cooked through.
