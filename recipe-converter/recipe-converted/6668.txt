For the naan bread, sift together all the dry ingredients in a bowl and mix until well combined.


Mix the milk and vegetable oil in a jug and pour into the dry ingredients. Combine the mixture and knead on a clean work surface for 6–8 minutes.


Place the dough into a bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave in a warm place for 15 minutes.


Meanwhile for the dip, place all the ingredients in a bowl and mix until well combined. Garnish with sesame seeds and set to one side while you make the naan breads.


Divide the dough into 4-6 balls and roll them out on a floured work surface into circles..


Rub the dough circles with oil and place into a heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat for for 1–2 minutes on each side. (You may need to do this in batches.)


Brush the bread with melted butter and serve immediately with the squash and tahini dip.
