Ingredients

2 free-range eggs, lightly beaten
80g/2¾oz caster sugar
240ml/8½fl oz milk
100g/3½oz butter, melted
300g/10½oz plain flour
2 tsp baking powder
½ tsp salt
pinch cinnamon
2 eating apples, peeled, cored, finely chopped
200g/7oz shop-bought toffee pieces




Method


Preheat the oven to 190C/380F/Gas 5 and line a 12-hole muffin tin with paper cases.


Mix the eggs, sugar, milk and melted butter in a large bowl. Sift the flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon into the bowl. Stir well to combine.


Add the chopped apple and lightly mix.


Using half of the mixture, quarter-fill each of the muffin cases with the mixture and top with a few pieces of toffee. Cover with the remaining filling so the cases are half full.


Bake for 30-35 minutes until well risen and golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Serve warm or cold.
