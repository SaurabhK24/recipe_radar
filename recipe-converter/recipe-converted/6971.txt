Beurre noisette may sound fancy but it's really very simple and adds a touch of luxury to this pan fried cod recipe.

Ingredients
For the red wine reduction

110ml/4fl oz red wine vinegar
110g/4oz caster sugar

For the griddled baby leeks

12 baby leeks
2 tbsp rapeseed oil
salt and black pepper

For the cod with beurre noisette

110g/4oz unsalted butter
4 x 150-200g/5½-7oz cod fillets, skin on
2 tbsp baby capers
½ lemon, juice only
2 tbsp finely chopped fresh parsley




Method


For the red wine reduction, put the red wine vinegar, sugar and 110ml/4fl oz water into a saucepan and cook until reduced to a syrup consistency.


For the griddled baby leeks, bring a pan of salted water to the boil, add the leeks and cook until just tender, then drain and pat dry. Heat a griddle pan until hot, toss the leeks in a little oil, salt and black pepper and char on each side until scorched.


For the cod with beurre noisette and capers, preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Heat a knob of butter in a frying pan over a medium-high heat. When the butter is foaming, add the cod and fry for 1-2 minutes on each side. Transfer to the oven to finish cooking (2-3 minutes).


Add the remaining butter and, once brown, add the capers and lemon juice.


To serve, put the leeks in the centre of the plate and place the cod on top. Pour the capers and red wine reduction over and around the fish. Garnish with chopped parsley.
