A gorgeous twist on a midweek winter favourite, using three cheeses and crunchy walnuts to perk up a classic.

Ingredients

1 cauliflower, trimmed and cut into 1cm/0.5in pieces
10oz/300g cream cheese
1 tsp Dijon mustard
4oz/125g blue cheese, crumbled
1oz/25g walnuts, roughly chopped
2oz/50g cheddar cheese, grated
salt
freshly ground black pepper

To serve

watercress salad




Method


Bring 5cm/2in depth of water to the boil in a saucepan, add the cauliflower and cook for about 8 minutes, or until tender. Drain, and return the cauliflower to the pan.


Mix the cream cheese and mustard with the cauliflower, then stir in the blue cheese. Season with a little salt if necessary and plenty of pepper.


Pour the mixture into a shallow gratin dish. Scatter the walnuts on top, then cover with the cheddar (this helps to prevent the walnuts from burning). Place under a preheated hot grill for 10-15 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the inside hot and bubbling.


Serve at once with a watercress salad.
