Ingredients

30g/1oz butter
1 small leek, finely diced
1 bulb fennel, finely sliced
200g/7oz chestnut mushrooms, sliced (optional)
3 shallots, finely chopped
pinch curry powder
pinch saffron strands
sprigs of thyme
250ml/9fl oz white wine
590g/1lb 5oz fresh mussels, cleaned and beards removed
200ml/7fl oz double cream
small bunch parsley, snipped and finely chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


In a large pan, melt the butter and add the leek, fennel and mushrooms (if using) the shallots, curry powder, saffron and thyme. Cover the pan and gently sweat the vegetables for about 5 minutes, or until soft but not coloured.


Add the wine and bring to the boil, then add the mussels. Cover and cook, shaking occasionally until all the mussels are open. Discard any which remain closed.


Strain and return the liquor to the pan. Cook uncovered for 5 minutes to reduce before adding the cream and parsley.


Bring back to the boil, return the mussels to the pan, allow to heat for a minute or so and serve immediately with crusty bread.
