Ingredients

1 mini panettone
1 tsp sunflower oil
175g/6oz dried soft figs
3 tbsp light muscovado sugar
100m/3½fl oz double cream
25g/1oz butter
4 tbsp maraschino liqueur




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Slice off the top of the panettone and pick out the soft inside leaving a 5mm/¼inch thick edge (reserve the crumbs to use in another dish, or eat as they are!).


Brush the inside of the panettone with the oil and place on a baking sheet. Bake in the oven for five minutes until lightly toasted.


Meanwhile, heat a heavy-bottomed frying pan. Slice the figs and add to the hot pan with the sugar and cream. Simmer gently until heated through, stirring occasionally.


Whisk in the butter and then carefully pour the maraschino into the pan and flambé (CAUTION: be careful of flames and any loose clothing or surrounding items in your kitchen).


Spoon the fig mixture into the hollowed out panettone and serve at once.
