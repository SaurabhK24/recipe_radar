Ingredients
For the cinnamon madeleines

225g/8oz butter, plus extra for greasing
1 vanilla pod
250g/9oz sugar, plus 75g/2½oz for dusting
250g/9oz plain flour
2 tbsp clear honey
3 free-range eggs
½ tsp ground cinnamon, for dusting

For the winter caramel sauce

100g/3½oz caster sugar
350ml/12fl oz double cream
1 star anise
½ cinnamon stick
25g/1oz butter




Method


For the madeleines, preheat the oven to 170C/325F/Gas 5 and butter the madeline tins.


Heat the butter until just melted.


Split the vanilla pods and scrape out the seeds, reserving the pod.


Place the sugar and flour into a bowl then add the vanilla seeds, honey and eggs then whisk in the melted butter until you have a nice smooth batter.


Spoon the batter into the tins, only half filling each indent.


Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden-brown. (Depending on the size of the madeleines, small ones may take only 8-10 minutes.)


Mix the ground cinnamon and sugar for dusting on a plate, then roll the madeleines quickly in the sugar to coat them thoroughly.


For the winter caramel sauce, heat the sugar in a pan until it turns a light golden-brown. Pour in half the cream and bring to the boil, stirring well.


Add the star anise, cinnamon, reserved vanilla pod and butter and the rest of the cream. Cook for 2-3 minutes until thickened and smooth.


Strain through a fine sieve into a serving bowl.


Serve the madeleines with the sauce. They can be kept in an airtight container for up to a week.
