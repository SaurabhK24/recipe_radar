Ingredients
For the dough

50ml/2oz olive oil, plus extra for greasing
500g/1lb 2oz strong white flour
10g/2tsp salt
25g/1oz fresh yeast
300ml/11floz cold water

For the Italian filling

150g/5oz green olives, finely chopped
3-5 slices Parma ham
2-3 packs buffalo mozzarella, thickly sliced
20g¾oz basil leaves, roughly torn

For the Cypriot filling

150g/5oz black olives, finely chopped
1 tbsp coriander, roughly chopped
2-3 packs halloumi cheese
½ tsp dried mint
3-5 slices Lounza ham




Method


Lightly oil two round tins 25cm/10in in diameter, 10cm/4in high with olive oil.


Place the flour, salt, oil, yeast and water into a large bowl and mix together until all the flour has been used up by the water.


Tip the dough onto a floured surface and knead for six minutes, then place the dough back into the bowl to prove for one hour.


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Divide the dough into eight equal pieces and roll each piece into a circle so it will just fit into the tin.


Place one in the bottom of one of the tins and spread the chopped green olives over the top evenly.


Place another dough circle on top of the olives and cover with parma ham.


Place another dough circle on the parma and cover with mozzarella.


Rip the basil and place on the top of the cheese.


Place a final dough circle on the top and leave to rise for one hour.


Repeat with the Cypriot fillings and remaining dough circles.


Place both tins in the oven for 30-40 minutes until golden brown.


Remove from the tins once cooled slightly, cut into wedges and serve warm or cold.
