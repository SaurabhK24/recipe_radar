Ingredients

2 partridges or 1 large pheasant
3 slices of lean ham
55g/2oz butter
2 onions, shredded
1 head of celery
1 large carrot
1 turnip
a small lump of sugar
salt and pepper, to taste
2.26litre/4 pints stock




Method


Cut up the partridges, and braise the pieces in the butter until tender, then take out the best joints and set them aside.


Add to the remainder the onions, the celery, and 3 pints of the stock.


Simmer slowly for 1 hour, strain and take the fat off as clean as possible; cut the flesh from the parts saved in neat pieces, and add with the sugar and seasoning, give one boil and skim again to make sure it is quite clear.


Simmer the carrot and turnip, cut up in the remaining pint of stock, and when quite tender, add to the soup. Bones and trimmings of game and the inferior parts of birds can be used to make more economical soup.
