Ingredients

85g/3oz caster sugar
150g/6oz butter, chopped, plus extra for greasing
150g/6oz dark chocolate (70% cocoa solids), roughly chopped
3 free-range egg yolks
3 whole free-range eggs
1 tbsp plain flour
double cream, to serve (optional)




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease 4 small dariole moulds or individual pudding basins.


Place the sugar, butter and chocolate into a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water.


Heat very gently until the butter and chocolate have melted, then remove from the heat.


Whisk together until combined.


Add the egg yolks and whole eggs and beat well.


Fold in the flour.


Pour into the dariole moulds or pudding basins and place in the fridge to chill for at least 20-25 minutes.


Remove from the fridge and place onto a baking tray. Put straight into the oven and cook for 8-9 minutes.


Allow to rest for a minute or two, then turn out onto individual serving plates.


Serve with a dollop of double cream, if you like.
