Nothing beats making your own pizza dough. Here it’s topped with gruyère and salami for a delicious Alpine taste.

From Two Greedy Italians






Ingredients
For the dough

500g/1lb 2oz strong plain flour, plus extra for dusting
2 tsp salt
1 x 7g sachet of dried yeast
320ml/11fl oz lukewarm water
dried breadcrumbs or semolina, for dusting

For the topping

80g/3oz gruyère cheese, grated
250g/9oz crème fraîche
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 large red onion, thinly sliced
140g/5oz salami, cut into strips
marjoram leaves, to finish




Method


For the pizza dough, combine the flour, salt and yeast in a large bowl. Gradually add the water, mixing well with your hands to obtain a dough. If you find the dough too sticky, simply add a little more flour. Shape into a ball, cover with a cloth and leave to rest for five minutes.


Knead the dough for about 10 minutes and split it in half. Sprinkle some flour on a clean kitchen cloth and place the pieces of dough on it. Cover with a slightly damp cloth and leave to rise for at least 30 minutes in a warm place.


Preheat the oven to 240C/475F/Gas 9.


Meanwhile, for the topping, combine the gruyère and crème fraîche in a bowl, adding some salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.


Once the dough has risen, sprinkle some flour on a clean work surface and spread one dough ball into a circle about 30cm/12in in diameter, making it as thin as possible (without tearing it), with the border slightly thicker. Repeat with the other dough ball. Sprinkle two flat baking trays with breadcrumbs or semolina and place the pizza bases on them.


Spread the crème fraîche mixture over each base. Top with the onions and salami. Bake in the hot oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven, sprinkle with the marjoram and serve.
