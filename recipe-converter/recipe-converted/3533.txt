Ingredients
For the devilled liver

2 rashers unsmoked back bacon
100g/3½oz lamb's liver, cut into 4 pieces
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil

For the carrot salad

2 large carrots, peeled
3 tbsp olive oil
½ orange, zest and juice
2 tbsp chopped fresh chives




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the devilled liver, trim the fat from the bacon and cut each rasher into two long strips. Season the liver with salt and freshly ground black pepper and roll a strip of bacon around each piece of liver, securing the end with a cocktail stick.


Heat the oil in an ovenproof griddle pan and sear the liver and bacon parcels on all sides. Place the pan into the oven to cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until cooked through.


For the carrot salad, using a mandoline, shred the carrots into long strips. Whisk the olive oil, orange zest and juice and chives together in a small bowl, then pour over the carrots and stir.


To serve, place the devilled liver on top of a bed of the carrot salad on a serving plate.
