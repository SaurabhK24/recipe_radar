Ingredients
For the sabayon

3 free-range egg yolks
50g/2oz caster sugar
110ml/3fl oz champagne
6 fresh basil leaves, finely chopped

For the berry gratin

50g/2oz raspberries
50g/2oz strawberries
50g/2oz blackberries
50g/2oz blueberries
50g/2oz caster sugar




Method


For the sabayon, place a glass bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Add the egg yolks and sugar and whisk continuously, until pale and light.


Add the champagne and continue whisking until pale and fluffy. (The foam must be sufficiently thickened so that it won't break down when it cools.) Remove from the heat and cool until tepid.


For the berry gratin, place all of the berries and the sugar into a bowl and mix together. Then divide evenly among four ovenproof bowls.


Add the basil to the sabayon, mix well, then spoon the sabayon over the berries.


Using a mini-blowtorch, heat the top of the sabayon until it turns golden-brown, then serve immediately.
