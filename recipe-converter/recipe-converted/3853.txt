You will need warm, sterilised jam jars and jam pot covers - prepare jars by washing in hot soapy water and leaving to dry and warm in a cool oven - 130C/250F/Gas ½ for 10-15 minutes.



Ingredients

1.35kg/3lb ripe figs, washed and diced
1.35kg/3lb warm preserving sugar (see note below)
1½ tbsp ground ginger
1 cooking apple, peeled and diced
4 tbsp crystallised stem ginger, chopped roughly
5 tbsp white wine vinegar
3 lemons, juice only
290ml/½ pint water




Method


Put the figs, sugar and ground ginger into a large non-metallic bowl, cover and leave for 6-8 hours.


Transfer the figs and sugar to a large saucepan or preserving pan, add the apple, crystallised ginger, vinegar, lemons and water. Stir over a low heat until the sugar has dissolved. Bring to the boil and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until the fruit is soft and setting point is reached.


Remove the jam from the heat and leave to cool for 20-25 minutes. Pour into the warm jam jars and cover/seal straight away.


Label and store in a cool dark place for 2-3 weeks to allow the flavours to develop.




Recipe Tips
To warm the sugar, pour into a baking tray and then heat in a low oven - 140C/275F/Gas 1 for 15-20 minutes before using.
