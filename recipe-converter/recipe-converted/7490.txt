Ingredients

350g/12oz wholewheat penne
1 tbsp extra virgin rapeseed oil or olive oil
2 spring onions, finely chopped
200g/7oz reduced-fat mascarpone cheese
4 tbsp lemon juice
400g/14oz frozen peas, thawed
400g/14oz frozen baby broad beans, thawed
1 small bunch of basil, roughly chopped, a few leaves reserved for garnish
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Cook the penne in a large saucepan of boiling water for 10-12 minutes, or until al dente.


Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium-low heat, add the spring onions and fry for 1-2 minutes or until softened. Stir in the mascarpone, lemon juice, peas, broad beans and basil. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir for 1-2 minutes or until bubbling.


Drain the penne, reserving a little of the cooking water. Stir the pasta into the peas and beans. Add a little of the pasta cooking water, if needed, to loosen the mixture. Garnish with basil and serve.
