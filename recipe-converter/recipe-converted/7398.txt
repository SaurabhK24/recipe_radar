Ingredients

225g/8oz quantity sweet pastry
250g/9oz block white marzipan
3 peaches, peeled if preferred
2 eggs
3 tbsp crème fraîche
sugar
½ tsp ground cinnamon
flaked almonds




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


Line a 20cm/8in diameter loose-bottomed deep flan tin with the pastry.


Roll out the marzipan to make a circle that is just smaller than the base and put into the pastry base.


Halve the peaches and arrange in the pastry case.


Beat the eggs with the crème fraîche and cinnamon, with a little extra sugar. Pour over the peaches.


Roll out any extra pastry to make a small disk to go on top of the peaches. Sprinkle with flaked almonds, bake until set and slightly browned on top, about 20-25 minutes. Serve warm.
