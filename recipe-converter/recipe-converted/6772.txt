Ingredients

250g/9oz strong white flour
1 tsp salt
½ tsp caster sugar
1 tsp instant yeast
6 olives, stones removed, chopped
sprig fresh rosemary, leaves only, finely chopped
1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing




Method


Put the flour, salt, sugar and yeast together in a bowl and mix them together using a fork. Stir in the olives and rosemary.


Make a well in the centre of the mixture and add 150ml/5½fl oz warm water and the oil. Stir the mixture until it comes together in a ball.


Tip the dough out onto a work surface and knead the dough by stretching it, folding it over and repeating. Keep kneading the dough until it looks and feels smooth. Sprinkle with a little flour if it feels sticky.


Put the dough back in the bowl, cover with a tea towel and st aside in a warm place for 45 minutes - 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.


Preheat the oven to 230C/450F/Gas 8. Grease a baking tray.


Divide the dough into eight pieces, roll each piece into a ball and place on a baking tray.


Bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until risen and golden-brown.
