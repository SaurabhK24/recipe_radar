Ingredients

2 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp plain flour
6 boneless and skinless chicken thighs, quartered
100g/3½ oz bacon pieces or pancetta
8 button onions, halved
100g/3½ oz button mushrooms
2 tsp of tomato purée
2 tbsp brandy
300ml/10fl oz red wine
1 bay leaf
2 tsp fresh thyme leaves
sea salt and freshly ground pepper




Method


Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a heavy saucepan.


Season the flour with salt and pepper and toss the chicken in.


Fry the chicken for 2-3 minutes or until it begins to brown.


Transfer the chicken to a plate to keep it warm.


Add the remaining 1 tbsp oil and fry the pancetta until it starts to brown.


Add the onions and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the mushrooms and fry for 1 minute.


Add the tomato purée, stir well and cook through for 30 seconds.


Return chicken to pan and add brandy, red wine and herbs. Bring liquid to boil, reduce and simmer for 15 - 20 minutes until chicken is tender and the liquid is thickened.


Serve with mash or rice.




Recipe Tips
- If you're having a dinner party or aiming to impress grease a ramekin with butter or a touch of oil. Pack it with rice and turn out onto a plate to create a perfect mould.
  - Don't wash the mushrooms as they'll absorb the water and loose their flavour. Simply wipe them clean.
