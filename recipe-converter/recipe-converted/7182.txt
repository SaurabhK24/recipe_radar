Ingredients

8 chicken breasts
olive oil
salt and freshly ground pepper

For the basil dressing

1 handful of fresh basil
600ml/1 pint olive oil
150ml/Â¼ pint rice wine vinegar
1 shallot, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves crushed
salt and freshly ground pepper

For the parsley salad

4 handfuls Italian curly parsley, de-stalked
Worcestershire sauce
8 chopped sun-dried or blushed tomatoes

Method


First make the basil dressing. Whiz the basil with the oil, vinegar, shallot, garlic and seasoning in a blender or food processor. Keep aside.


Brush the chicken breast with olive oil and cook on a pre-heated grill pan until just cooked through. The chicken should be golden on both sides and criss-crossed with markings from the grill pan. Season.


For the salad, toss the parsley in a little of the basil dressing, and sprinkle with a little Worcestershire sauce. Put a portion of parsley salad on each plate, sprinkle with a few pieces of sun-dried tomato and slivers of parmesan cheese.


Serve with rustic roast potatoes or buffalo chips.
