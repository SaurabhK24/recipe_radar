Ingredients
For the beef

1 x 100g/3½oz piece beef fillet
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the blue cheese butter

25g/1oz blue cheese, crumbled
1 tbsp butter, softened
small handful fresh herbs, such as chervil, chives, parsley and sage, leaves only, finely chopped
1 tsp Dijon mustard

For the sautéed mushrooms and cabbage

1 tsp olive oil
knob of butter
¼ savoy cabbage, roughly chopped
1 Portabello mushroom, quartered




Method


For the griddled beef, rub the beef all over with olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Heat a griddle pan until hot and cook the beef for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking. Set aside and leave to rest.


For the blue cheese butter, place all the blue cheese butter ingredients into a bowl and roughly mash with a fork until combined.


For the sautéed mushrooms and cabbage, heat the oil and butter in a pan and gently fry the cabbage and mushroom pieces for 5-6 minutes, or until tender.


To serve, place the cabbage and mushrooms onto a plate and top with the beef and a spoonful of the blue cheese butter. Drizzle over any meat juices from the pan.
