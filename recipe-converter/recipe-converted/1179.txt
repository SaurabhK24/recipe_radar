Ingredients
For the chicken

1.5kg/3½lb whole chicken
4 tbsp natural unsweetened yoghurt
1 tsp garam masala
4 tbsp single cream
2 tbsp medium-hot paprika
1 tsp medium-hot chilli powder
1 tsp ground cumin
2 tbsp lemon juice
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tsp salt
½ tsp turmeric
1 tbsp tomato purée
4 garlic cloves, crushed
2 tsp peeled and finely grated root ginger

For the coriander chutney

100g/4oz coriander leaves, roughly chopped
3 green finger chillies, roughly chopped
1 garlic clove, roughly chopped (optional)
½ tsp salt
1 tsp lemon juice
1 tsp demerara sugar




Method


Prick the chicken all over and make a few slits about 2cm/¾in long on the skin.


Mix all the remaining chicken ingredients into a smooth paste and rub the marinade generously all over the chicken skin. Cover and refrigerate for eight hours or overnight.


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Place the chicken in a roasting tin and cover with foil. Roast in the centre of the oven for 1½ hours. Halfway through cooking, baste with a little of the marinade.


Remove chicken from the oven and leave in a warm place to rest for 20 minutes.


Meanwhile, for the coriander chutney, place all the ingredients in a blender and blend until the mixture become a coarse paste. Add 4-5 tablespoons of cold water to ease blending. Alternatively, use a pestle and mortar. This chutney can be stored in an airtight, non-metallic container for up to four days in the refrigerator.
