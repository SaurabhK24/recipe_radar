Ingredients

85g/3oz sirloin steak
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
100ml/3½fl oz white wine
100ml/3½fl oz double cream
1 red chilli, chopped
3 tbsp chopped fresh coriander

To serve

85g/3oz egg noodles, cooked according to packet instructions, drained




Method


Rub the steak with the oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a chargrill pan until smoking, then add the steak and chargrill for 1-2 minutes on both sides (for rare), or for longer if you prefer your steak medium or well done. Remove the steak from the pan to rest on a warm plate.


Return the pan to the heat and deglaze with the wine. Simmer for 5-6 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by about a third. Stir in the cream and chilli and cook for a further 2-3 minutes, then stir in half of the coriander.


To serve, place the egg noodles on a serving plate and top with the steak. Pour over the spicy cream sauce and garnish with the remaining coriander.
