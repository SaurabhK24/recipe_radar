Ingredients
For the pomegranate mousse

100ml/3½fl oz double cream
1 tbsp caster sugar
1 tbsp Greek-style yoghurt
½ pomegranate, seeds only

For the ginger shortbread

175g/6oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting
1 tsp ground ginger
100g/3½oz butter
55g/2oz caster sugar, plus extra for sprinkling
water, to bind

To serve

fresh mint sprigs, to garnish




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


For the pomegranate mousse, whip the cream and sugar together in a bowl until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Gently fold in the yoghurt and the pomegranate seeds.


For the shortbread, place all of the shortbread ingredients into a food processor and pulse, gradually adding enough water to bind into a dough. Tip the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead lightly to bring the dough together into a ball.


Roll the dough out to a thickness of 1cm/½inch and cut into rectangles. Place onto a non-stick baking sheet and sprinkle over the caster sugar and prick the dough with a fork. Bake in the oven for 5-7 minutes, or until golden-brown.


To serve, spoon the mousse into a tall serving glass and garnish with a sprig of mint. Serve the shortbread on a plate alongside.
