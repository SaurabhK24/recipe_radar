Ingredients

2 aubergines sliced lengthways and grilled with olive oil until golden
1 ball of mozzarella
1 lemon, juice and zest only
1 clove of garlic, finely chopped
2 tbsp chopped flat parsley
150g/5oz fresh white breadcrumbs
100g/3½oz cherry tomatoes

For the salsa verde

big bunch of mint
big bunch of basil
big bunch of parsley
1 clove garlic
1 lemon, juice and zest only
70ml/2½fl oz good olive oil
30g/1oz pine nuts




Method


In a food processor, blend the breadcrumbs, mozzarella, lemon, garlic and parsley until a crumb consistency appears.


Make small balls of this and roll them up in the aubergine slices. Place in a baking dish.


Roast the cherry tomatoes in some olive oil for about 20 minutes, until soft. When they are cooked, crush them lightly with a fork.


Spoon some of the crushed tomatoes over the aubergine rolls and bake in the oven with plenty of olive oil for ten to fifteen minutes at 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Place all the salsa verde ingredients in a food processor and blend to a coarse consistency. Divide the rest of the crushed tomatoes between four serving plates, lay two or three aubergines rolls on top and spoon over some salsa verde to serve.
