30g/1oz caster sugar
1 peach, cut in half and stone removed

For the sabayon

5 egg yolks
30ml/1¼fl oz muscat wine
55g/2oz caster sugar
1 vanilla pod, split and seeds scraped out




Method


Heat the wine and sugar in a pan over a gentle heat. Add the peach halves and poach for 8-10 minutes.


For the sabayon, whisk the egg yolks, wine, sugar and vanilla seeds in a bowl over a pan of simmer water for up to 10 minutes, until pale, thickened and fluffy and the mixture leaves a ribbon trail.


Remove the peaches from the liquor and transfer to a serving plate. Spoon a little of the sabayon on top and drizzle a little liquor over, to serve.
