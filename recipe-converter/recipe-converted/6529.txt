Ingredients
For the beans

200g/7oz baked beans
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 tbsp soft brown sugar
pinch dried chilli flakes
1 tbsp soy sauce

For the bruschetta

4 thick slices ciabatta
110g/4oz cheddar, cut into four slices
55g/2oz streaky bacon, cut into strips and fried until crisp




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


For the beans, gently cook all of the beans ingredients in a small saucepan over a medium heat for ten minutes, stirring occasionally.


Meanwhile, for the bruschetta, heat a griddle pan until smoking. Add the ciabatta slices and toast for two minutes on each side.


Remove the ciabatta from the griddle and place a slice of cheese on each piece. Place onto a baking sheet and place into the oven to bake for five minutes, or until the cheese has melted.


To serve, carefully remove the ciabatta from the oven and place onto plates. Pour over the beans and garnish with the bacon pieces.
