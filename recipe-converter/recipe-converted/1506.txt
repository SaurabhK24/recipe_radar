Ingredients
For the salad

2 back bacon slices, fat trimmed
1 Little Gem lettuce, leaves separated, chopped
1 avocado, peeled, stone removed, chopped

For the dressing

squeeze of lemon juice
2 tbsp olive oil
¼ garlic clove, crushed
¼ tsp Dijon mustard

For the croutons

2 thick slices bread, cut into chunks
1 tbsp oil




Method


Heat a large frying pan and fry the bacon until it is crisp and browned on both sides. When the bacon is cool enough to handle slice into thin pieces, trimming any visible fat off.


Put all of the salad ingredients in a bowl and set aside.


For the dressing, put all the dressing ingredients in a bowl and combine thoroughly to form a smooth dressing.


For the croutons, heat the oil in a frying pan and, when hot, add the bread cubes. Cook 2-3 minutes, or until golden.


Add the croutons to the salad bowl and drizzle over the salad dressing.
