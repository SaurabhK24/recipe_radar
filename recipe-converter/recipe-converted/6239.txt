Sometimes all you need is a really good sandwich and this one with homemade meatballs and tomato sauce is just the trick.






By Nick Nairn






Ingredients
For the meatballs

100g/3½oz minced beef
1 small garlic clove, finely chopped
4 tsp olive oil

For the sauce

½ onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
3 tomatoes, chopped
1 tbsp tomato ketchup
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley (optional)
salt and freshly ground black pepper

To serve

1 small baguette or baton, sliced in half
simple green salad




Method


For the meatballs, put the mince and garlic in a bowl and mix well to combine. Shape into small meatballs with wet hands.


Heat the olive oil in a pan and fry the meatballs for 5-6 minutes, turning frequently, until browned all over and cooked through. Remove the meatballs from the pan, set aside and keep warm.


For the sauce, fry the onion and garlic in the pan the meatballs were cooked in for 2-3 minutes, or until softened. Stir in the tomatoes and ketchup. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer for 3-4 minutes, or until the tomatoes are tender, then stir in the chopped parsley (if using).


Return the meatballs to the pan to warm through in the sauce. Spoon into the baguette and serve with a green salad alongside.
