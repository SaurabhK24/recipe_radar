Ingredients

1 Red rooster potato
1 tbsp olive oil
200ml/7fl oz single cream
1 heaped tspn Dijon mustard
1 lemon, zest and juice of half
2 free-range yolks
35g/1¼oz grated parmesan
2 tbsp chopped fresh basil
salt and freshly ground black pepper
sugar
1 x 500g/1lb 2oz Scottish lobster, meat removed, diced

For the salad

1 cucumber, peeled, seeds removed, diced
2 tbsp chopped fresh flatleaf parsley
200g/7oz cherry tomatoes, quartered
1 red onion, finely sliced
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 lemon, juice only




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Bake the potato for 1-1¼ hours or until tender. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool slightly. Cut the potato in half and scoop out the flesh.


Heat the cream, Dijon mustard, lemon zest and lemon juice together in a pan until boiling.


Whisk in the egg yolks until well combined, then stir in half the parmesan and all of the basil. Season, to taste, with salt, sugar and freshly ground black pepper and continue to cook until the sauce thickens. Stir in the lobster meat.


Increase the oven to 225C/450F/Gas 8.


Spoon the lobster mixture into the potato shells, sprinkle over the remaining parmesan and bake for 3-4 minutes.


Meanwhile for the salad, mix all of the ingredients together in a bowl until well combined. Serve a spoonful of salad alongside the potato.
