This is excellent as a side dish with roast free-range chicken, or as a topping for bruschetta - griddle slices of good bread, rub with raw garlic, top with the cooked kale and then finish with a spoonful of mild, creamy young goats' cheese.






By Sophie Grigson






Ingredients

3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 large onion, sliced
2 sprigs fresh rosemary
1 medium or hot fresh red chilli, deseeded and thinly sliced
4 garlic cloves, sliced
250g/9oz curly kale or cavolo nero, trimmed of tough stems, rinsed and cut into 1cm/&frac12in thick slices
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Heat the olive oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed lidded pan over a medium heat. Add the onion, turn down the heat and fry gently until very tender.


Add the rosemary, chilli and garlic and fry for one more minute.


Add the kale or cavolo nero and season with salt. Cover with a tight-fitting lid, reduce the heat to its absolute minimum and leave to cook gently for about 20 minutes. Stir once after five minutes, then again ten minutes later.


Remove the rosemary stalks, then taste and adjust the seasoning. Serve at once.
