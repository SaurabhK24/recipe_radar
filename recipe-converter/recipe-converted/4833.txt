Ingredients

250g/9oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting
½ tsp baking powder
250g/9oz caster sugar
3 medium free-range eggs, beaten
200g/7oz chopped hazelnuts
1 large orange, finely grated zest only




Method


Preheat the oven to 170C/150C Fan/Gas 3 and line a large baking tray with baking parchment.


Mix together the flour, baking powder and sugar in a bowl and add the eggs slowly to make a dough. Mix in the hazelnuts and orange zest.


On a lightly floured surface, knead the mixture gently and divide into 2. Roll into logs, each approximately 25cm/10in long. Place on the lined baking tray and bake for 25 minutes.


Remove from the oven, leave to cool slightly, then cut each log into 1½-2cm/⅝-¾in thick slices. Lay the slices on the baking tray.


Return the tray to the oven and bake for another 5-7 minutes, turn over and continue to bake for another 5-7 minutes until golden-brown. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.
