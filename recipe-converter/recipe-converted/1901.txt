Ingredients
For the cheeseburger

500g/1lb 2oz beef steak mince
2 tbsp vegetable oil
25g/1oz beer mustard
100g/3½oz mayonnaise
8 gherkins, sliced
4 beef tomatoes, sliced
½ round lettuce, leaves separated
1 red onion, sliced
200g/7oz Monterey Jack cheese, grated or in slices
4 brioche rolls

For the fries

500g/1lb 2oz chipping potatoes
vegetable oil, for deep-fat frying

For the vanilla milkshake

1 vanilla pod, seeds removed
500ml/18fl oz full-fat milk
200g/7oz vanilla ice cream




Method


For the cheeseburger, put the mince in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Use your hands to shape the mince into four burger-shaped patties. Wrap the patties in cling film and place in the fridge for an hour.


Heat a large frying pan and add the oil. Once hot, add the burgers and cook each side for 2-3 minutes. When cooked, set aside to rest.


In a small bowl, mix the mustard with the mayonnaise.


For the fries, preheat a deep-fat fryer to 180C/350F. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Fry the chips for 3-4 minutes, then drain on kitchen paper and season with salt.


For the vanilla milkshake, place all the ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.


Just before serving, pour the milkshake into glasses.


To assemble the burger, place each patty in a brioche roll topped with the gherkins, sliced tomato, lettuce, a few onion slices, cheese and beer mustard mayonnaise.


Place the burgers on serving plates and secure with a wooden skewer. Place the fries alongside and serve with the milkshakes.
