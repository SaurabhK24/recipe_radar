Ingredients
For the pine-nut crusted salmon

55g/2oz breadcrumbs
1 garlic clove, peeled, crushed
2 tbsp pine nuts
25g/1oz butter
100g/3½oz salmon fillet
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the creamy mash

½ baking potato, peeled, chopped
2 tbsp double cream
25g/1oz butter

To serve

1 soft poached egg
3-4 cooked broccoli florets




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the pine nut-crusted salmon, blend the breadcrumbs, garlic, pine nuts and butter in a food processor until smooth.


Season the salmon with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then press the breadcrumb mixture onto the flesh side of the fish. Bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through. (NB: The salmon is cooked through when the flesh is opaque.)


For the creamy mash, boil the potato in salted water for 8-10 minutes or until the potato is tender. Mash the potato with the cream and butter until smooth.


To serve, spoon the mash onto a plate. Place the salmon on top of the potato. Top with the poached egg and spoon the cooked broccoli florets alongside.
