Ingredients
For the Greek salad

2 tbsp olive oil
1 lemon, juice only
150g/5½oz vine cherry tomatoes, halved
½ shallot, peeled and finely sliced
50g/2oz olives, pits removed
50g/2oz feta cheese, crumbled
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the bruschetta

4-6 slices ciabatta, depending on size of loaf
2 tbsp olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


To make the Greek salad, whisk together the olive oil and lemon juice in a bowl.


Add the cherry tomatoes, shallot, olives and feta cheese, then season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and toss together.


To make the bruschetta, heat a griddle pan until smoking. Drizzle the ciabatta slices with the oil and season both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Grill for one minute on each side.


To serve, place the bruschetta slices in the centre of a plate and spoon the Greek salad on top.
