Ingredients

100g/3½oz breadcrumbs, toasted
50g/1¾oz unsalted butter
250g/9oz cream cheese
100g/3½oz caster sugar
50g/1¾oz icing sugar
½ orange, juice and zest
½ lemon, juice and zest
mint sprig, to garnish




Method


Place the toasted breadcrumbs, butter and caster sugar into a food processor and blend to mix.


Whisk together the cream cheese, icing sugar, orange and lemon juice and zest in a large bowl.


Grease the inside of a tall 7cm/3in chefs' ring, and place into the centre of a plate. Spoon in the breadcrumb mixture and press down until the ring is half-filled with biscuit base.


Spoon the cream cheese mixture into the ring and smooth the top with a palette knife.


To serve, carefully remove the chefs' ring and garnish with a mint sprig.
