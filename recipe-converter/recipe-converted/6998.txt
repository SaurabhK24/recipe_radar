Ingredients

2 free-range eggs
½ orange, zest only
100g/3½oz self-raising flour
½tsp baking powder
75ml/2¾fl oz milk
25g/1oz unsalted butter
1 tbsp vegetable oil

To serve

icing sugar, for dusting
½ orange, peeled and segmented
3 tbsp maple syrup




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Place the eggs, orange zest, flour, baking powder and milk into a large bowl and whisk together to form a smooth batter.


Heat the butter and oil in a shallow frying pan over a medium heat.


Ladle a quarter of the batter mixture to the pan to make a large thick pancake. Cook for one minute on each side, until golden.


Transfer to a baking sheet and repeat the pancake-making process to cook three more pancakes.


Once you have four pancakes placed on the baking sheet, place into the oven to bake for two minutes.


To serve, stack the pancakes onto a warm plate and dust with icing sugar. Arrange the orange segments around the plate and drizzle the pancakes with maple syrup.
