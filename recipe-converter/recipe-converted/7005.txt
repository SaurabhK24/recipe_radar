Ingredients
For the fish

1 tbsp olive oil
1 hake fillet
4 slices pancetta

For the potatoes

30g/1oz unsalted butter, plus more if necessary
1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed
4 spring onions, finely chopped
splash white wine
1 tsp fresh chives, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
150g/5¼oz new potatoes, cooked




Method


To make the fish, heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan. Wrap the hake in the pancetta slices and then pan fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the pancetta is golden brown.


For the potatoes, gently melt the butter in a pan and sauté the garlic and spring onion for two minutes, to soften. Stir in the wine, chives and salt and freshly ground black pepper. Over a gentle heat whisk in a little more butter to make a sauce.


Add the new potatoes to the pan to warm through.


To serve, transfer the buttery potatoes to a serving plate and serve the wrapped fish alongside.
