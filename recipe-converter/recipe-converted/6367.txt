Ingredients

1 quantity shortcrust sugar pastry
3 tbsp sweet mincemeat
1 lightly beaten egg white and caster sugar to glaze
1 star cutter
1 tub of clotted cream




Method


Preheat oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.


On a lightly floured surface, roll out half of the pastry to 1/8in/3mm thickness. Using a 3in/8cm fluted cutter, stamp out twelve circles of pastry. Gently press these into patty tins.


Spoon about 2tsp mincemeat into each tin.


Roll out the remaining pastry and cut out twelve stars. Dampen the points and place on top of the mincemeat, letting the points seal on the pastry below.


Brush the tops with the egg white, then sprinkle lightly with caster sugar. Bake for 15 -20 minutes.


Leave in the tins for 5 minutes before removing.


Serve warm with clotted cream.
