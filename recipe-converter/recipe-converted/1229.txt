Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
1 onion, sliced
2 garlic cloves, sliced
2 leeks, cut into slices
200g/7oz cavolo nero, chopped
200g/7oz butternut squash, cut into cubes and roasted until golden-brown
440g/15½oz can chopped tomatoes
splash white wine
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the topping

225g/8oz flour
3 tsp baking powder
pinch salt
100g/3½oz cubed butter
175ml/6fl oz soured cream

For the dressing

150ml/5fl oz olive oil
bunch fresh basil
½ lemon, juice only




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and fry until softened.


Add the leeks and cavolo nero and cook for 3-4 minutes.


Add the squash, tomatoes, wine and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Simmer for 5-6 minutes, then divide between four individual ovenproof dishes or ramekins.


For the topping, place the flour, baking powder, salt and butter into a food processor and pulse until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.


Add the soured cream and pulse again until it just comes together as a very sticky dough.


Spoon dollops of the topping over the contents of each ramekin, then bake for 25 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown.


For the dressing, place the oil, basil and lemon juice into a clean food processor and blend until smooth.


Serve the cobblers at the table in their ramekins and spoon over the dressing.
