Ingredients

350g/12oz self-raising flour
225g/8oz margarine
175g/6oz caster sugar
125g/4oz sultanas
2 tsp powdered cinnamon
2.5ml/½ tsp nutmeg or mace
450g/1lb cooking apples, peeled, cored and cut into small pieces
3 eggs, beaten lightly
pinch of salt
icing sugar




Method


Heat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2. Grease and line a 20cm/8in tin.


Sift the flour and salt together and rub in the margarine.


Sift in the sugar, sultanas and spices. Mix in the apples and then stir in the beaten eggs. Do not add any extra liquid even if the mixture seems a bit stiff. The moisture and flavour comes from the apples in the baking.


Bake in the oven for 1½-2 hours or until a skewer when inserted into the cake comes out clean.


Serve warm or cold, dusted with icing sugar.
