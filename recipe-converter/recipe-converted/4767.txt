Ingredients
For the potatoes

1 tbsp olive oil
150g/5¼oz new potatoes, cooked
4 spring onions, chopped
pinch curry powder
pinch turmeric
squeeze lemon juice
150ml/5fl oz double cream
handful fresh parsley leaves, chopped
pinch cumin seeds

For the fish

1 hake fillet
4 slices pancetta
oil, for frying
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


To make the curried potatoes, heat the oil in a sauté or large frying pan. Fry the potatoes and spring onions for a few minutes, to soften.


Stir in the curry powder and turmeric to coat. Add the lemon juice to the pan and then pour in the cream.


Add the parsley and cumin seeds and simmer gently for 8-10 minutes, until thickened.


For the fish, wrap the pancetta slices around the hake fillet. Heat the oil in a non-stick-frying pan and cook the fish for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the pancetta is golden brown.


To serve, transfer the wrapped fish to a serving plate and serve the curried potatoes alongside.
