This simple recipe for a homemade chicken kiev is so much better than shop-bought versions.






By Simon Rimmer






Ingredients
For the chicken kiev

4 x 175g/6oz chicken breasts, skin removed
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 lemon, juice only
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp chopped fresh tarragon
230g/8oz butter, slightly softened
2 tbsp plain flour
1 free-range egg, beaten
10-12 tbsp fresh breadcrumbs
olive oil, for frying

For the rice

250g/9oz cooked white and wild rice (from a packet of mixed white and wild rice)
100g/3½oz bacon lardons, fried until crisp
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
100g/3½oz pine nuts, toasted
2 tbsp melted butter




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the chicken kiev, slice a piece out of the centre of the chicken breast to make a pocket using a sharp knife. Place the garlic, lemon juice, salt and freshly ground black pepper, tarragon and butter into a bowl and mix well. Stuff this mixture into the pocket in the chicken breasts.


Dredge the chicken breasts in the flour, then dip into the beaten egg, then the breadcrumbs to coat completely, shaking off any excess.


Heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan and fry the chicken breasts on all sides until lightly browned. Transfer to the oven and bake for 18-20 minutes, or until golden-brown and completely cooked through.


For the rice, place all the rice ingredients into a bowl and mix well. Pack the rice mixture into four cups or ramekins.


To serve, turn the rice out onto serving plates with the chicken kiev alongside.
