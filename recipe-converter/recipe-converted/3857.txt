Ingredients
For the batter

2 tbsp plain flour
2 tbsp cornflour
fizzy cold water

For the fritters

vegetable oil, for frying
8 figs
vanilla ice cream, to serve




Method


Make the batter by sieving the plain flour and cornflour together into a large bowl. Whisk in enough fizzy cold water to make a batter the consistency of double cream.


Heat the oil in a deep heavy-bottomed pan. It is ready when a breadcrumb that is dropped in will sizzle gently in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Dip each fig into the batter, then carefully place into the hot oil. Deep fry for 2-3 minutes until crisp and golden brown. Remove using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towel.


Serve at once with scoops of vanilla ice cream.
