2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
½ Scotch Bonnet chilli, finely sliced
115g/4oz shiitake mushrooms, thickly sliced
100ml/3½fl oz white wine
100ml/3½fl oz double cream

For the griddled sesame beef

150g/5½oz fillet steak, sliced into three pieces

Method


For the creamy shiitake broth, heat the oil in a frying pan and gently fry the onion and garlic for 2-3 minutes.


Add the sliced chilli and mushrooms and continue frying for a further 4-5 minutes. Add the wine and cream and bring to a gentle simmer. Simmer for 3-4 minutes.


For the griddled sesame beef, rub the sesame oil into the beef and season well with freshly ground black pepper. Heat a griddle pan until hot, place the beef onto the griddle and sear on both sides, until cooked to your liking. Squeeze over the lime juice towards the end of cooking.


To serve, ladle the broth into a shallow soup bowl and arrange the griddled beef on top.
