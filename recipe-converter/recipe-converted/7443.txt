Ingredients
For the sauce

550ml/1 pint goats' milk
200g/7oz caster sugar
4 tbsp golden syrup
1 cinnamon stick
1 tsp baking powder

For the pears

50ml/2fl oz water
25g/1oz butter
25g/1oz caster sugar
4 Comice pears, peeled and finely chopped

To serve

300ml/10fl oz whipping cream, whipped
2 tbsp cocoa powder
mint leaves




Method


First make the sauce by putting the milk, half the sugar and the golden syrup in a pan. Bring to the boil.


Crumble the cinnamon stick into the milk and add the baking powder. Take the pan off the heat and stir well as the mix will rise quickly.


Continue to whisk the mixture until it stops rising and place back on the heat and bring back to the boil, whisking all the time.


Turn down the heat and cook for about 30 minutes on a gentle simmer, stirring all the time to prevent the mixture from burning.


Pass the mixture through a sieve and allow to cool.


For the pears, place the water, butter and sugar in a pan with a lid. Bring to the boil, then add the pears and stew for 10-15 minutes, until soft.


In four glasses, layer the pears, whipped cream and sauce in three layers. Top with cocoa powder and garnish with mint. Serve.
