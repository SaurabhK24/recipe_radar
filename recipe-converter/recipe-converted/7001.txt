Ingredients
For the baked pancetta eggs

sunflower oil, for greasing
12 slices pancetta
3 free-range eggs
125ml/4½fl oz double cream
20g/¾oz freshly grated parmesan
small handful fresh basil leaves, torn
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the pea and mint salad

240g/8½oz frozen peas
3 tbsp chopped fresh mint
1 lemon, juice only
2 tbsp olive oil
50g/1¾oz baby spinach leaves
100g/3½oz feta, crumbled
lavosh bread (flatbreads), to serve




Method


For the baked pancetta eggs, preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas mark 4 and grease 4 holes of a12-hole muffin tray.


Line each muffin hole with 3 slices of pancetta.


Whisk the eggs, cream, parmesan and basil leaves together in a bowl until well combined. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Divide the mixture among the muffin holes and bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the eggs are just set.


Meanwhile, for the pea and mint salad, pour boiling water over the frozen peas and set aside to stand for 2 minutes. Drain, then refresh in cold water.


Mix the peas, mint, lemon juice and olive oil in a bowl until well combined.


To serve, divide the spinach among each of 4 serving plates and spoon some pea and mint salad on top. Sprinkle over the crumbled feta. Serve the baked eggs alongside with the lavosh bread.
