Ingredients
For the salmon

3 slices smoked salmon
1 tbsp oil
½ lemon, juice only
freshly ground black pepper

For the tartare sauce

3 tbsp crème fraîche
1 tbsp Greek yoghurt
2 tbsp capers, rinsed, drained, and chopped
1 spring onion, finely chopped
½ lemon, juice only
handful fresh dill, chopped
handful fresh chives, chopped

To serve

handful fresh parsley
handful fresh basil
handful fresh coriander




Method


For the salmon, place three slices of smoked salmon on top of each other, then roll into a sausage shape. Curl the rolled salmon around and shape into a circle.


Heat the oil in a small frying pan over a medium heat. Add the smoked salmon and fry for two minutes on each side, until light pink and cooked through. Add the lemon juice and cook for another minute.


For the tartare sauce, place all the tartare sauce ingredients, except the dill and chives, into a small saucepan and warm over a low heat for two minutes. Remove from the heat and add the dill and chives and stir.


To serve, mix the parsley, basil and coriander together in a bowl. Place the mixed herbs onto a plate, place the pan-fried smoked salmon on top and pour over the tartare sauce.
