Ingredients

1 tbsp olive oil
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
½ banana shallot, sliced
½ red chilli, finely chopped
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp medium curry powder
1 tsp turmeric powder
2 tbsp tomato purée
200ml/7fl oz hot vegetable stock
250g/9oz sweet potato, peeled and cut into cubes
100g/3½oz broccoli stalk, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
15g/½oz chopped coriander, to garnish
50g/1¾oz Greek yoghurt, to garnish




Method


Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the garlic and shallots and fry until softened.


Add the chilli, cumin seeds, curry powder and turmeric powder and fry for a further minute to release the aromas.


Add the tomato purée and vegetable stock, stir well and bring to a simmer.


Add the sweet potato and broccoli and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the sweet potato is cooked through. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To serve, pour into a warm bowl, sprinkle with the fresh coriander and spoon the yoghurt into the middle.
