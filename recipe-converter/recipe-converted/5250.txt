Ingredients

450g/1lb loin of lamb
2 cloves garlic, crushed
100ml/3½fl oz plain yoghurt
1 lemon, juice only
2 tbsp garam masala
seasoning
extra virgin olive oil
1 courgette, cut into chunks and griddled
1 aubergine, cut into chunks and griddled
1 red pepper, cut into chunks and griddled
jar mint jelly
water




Method


Combine the garlic, yoghurt, lemon juice, garam masala, salt and pepper in a large bowl.


Add the lamb and stir to ensure everything is evenly coated. Cover with cling film and refrigerate for at least 2, but no more than 24 hours.


Heat a little oil in a non-stick frying pan, drain the lamb from its marinade and add to the pan. Fry for about 3 minutes on each side until cooked through. Remove from the pan and allow to rest.


To make the dressing, simply whisk the mint jelly with a little water.


To serve - slice the lamb and place in the centre of the plate, place the vegetables around and drizzle the sauce over.
