Ingredients
For the cake

100g/3½oz unsalted butter
250g/9oz caster or brown sugar
50ml/2fl oz sunflower oil
25g/1oz cocoa powder
2 tsp vanilla extract
4 medium free-range eggs
80ml/2½fl oz milk
100ml/3½fl oz double cream
300g/10½oz plain flour
3 tsp baking powder

For the cocoa frosting

25g/1oz cocoa powder
300g/10½oz icing sugar
50g/1¾oz butter
50ml/2fl oz double cream

For the filling

250ml/9fl oz double cream, whipped until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed
150g/5½oz jam




Method


For the cake, line the base of a deep 20cm/9in cake tin with non-stick paper and preheat the oven to180C/350F/Gas 4.


Melt the butter over a low heat in a small pan, pour it into a bowl with the sugar, oil, cocoa powder and vanilla. Beat well until smooth, then whisk in the eggs followed by the milk and cream.


Sift the flour and baking powder into the butter mixture and beat until smooth, then spoon into the prepared tin and cover the top of the tin with aluminium foil.


Bake for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for a further 20 minutes, or the top is springy and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.


Remove the cake from the oven and set aside to cool completely.


Meanwhile make the cocoa frosting, mix the cocoa powder and icing sugar in a bowl. Melt the butter for a few seconds in the microwave, or in a small pan over a low heat. Mix the melted butter and the cream into the sugar and cocoa, and stir until smooth.


To assemble the cake, remove the cake from the tin, trim the top of the cake to make it flat, then cut the cake in half horizontally. Put the bottom half of the cake onto a serving plate and spread with the whipped cream. Top with the jam.


Spread the cocoa frosting onto the top of the cake and swirl it with a spoon, then carefully place it onto the bottom half of the cake.




Recipe Tips
Try decorating the cake with hundreds and thousands or sugar sprinkles.
