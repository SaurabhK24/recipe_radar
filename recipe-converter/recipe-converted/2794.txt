Ingredients
For the rice pudding

50g/2oz butter
200g/7oz pudding rice
50g/2oz caster sugar
600ml/1 pint 2fl oz milk
500ml/18fl oz double cream
1 vanilla pod, seeds scraped out
110g/4oz clotted cream

For the raspberries

50g/2oz caster sugar
300g/10oz raspberries

For the orange caramel

75g/3oz caster sugar
1 orange, juice only




Method


For the rice pudding, heat a saucepan until hot. Add the butter and rice and cook for one minute, stirring to coat the rice with the melted butter.


Add the sugar, milk, double cream, vanilla pod and seeds. Stir well and bring to the boil.


Reduce the heat to a simmer and simmer gently for 30-40 minutes until the rice is tender and all the liquid has been absorbed by the rice. Remove the vanilla pod and discard (or rinse and dry thoroughly to use in another recipe of your choice).


Meanwhile, for the raspberries, heat a frying pan until hot and add the sugar and raspberries. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the raspberries are soft and the sugar has melted. Set aside to cool slightly.


For the orange caramel, heat a frying pan until hot. Add the sugar and heat until the sugar melts and starts to caramelise. Add the orange juice (take care as the caramel may spit) and whisk to combine.


When ready to serve, stir the clotted cream into the rice pudding and heat through. Spoon the raspberries into the bottom of a serving dish, top with the clotted cream rice pudding and pour the orange caramel over the top. Serve immediately.
