Ingredients

200g/7oz digestive biscuits, crushed
75g/3oz butter or vegan margarine, melted
1 lemon, zest and juice
200ml/7fl oz limoncello liqueur
3 tbsp agar-agar
400g/14oz firm tofu
1 tbsp vegan cream cheese
400g/14oz coconut cream
few drops vanilla essence
115g/4oz caster sugar

Method


In a bowl, mix the crushed biscuits with the butter or margarine. Press the mixture into the base of a 20cm/8in round springform cake tin.


In a pan set over a very low heat, add the lemon juice, limoncello, a splash of water and the agar-agar. Stir until the agar-agar has dissolved.


In a food processor, combine the tofu, cream cheese, coconut cream, a splash of vanilla essence, sugar and lemon zest. Blend until smooth.


Pour the tofu mixture over the biscuit base and smooth the surface. Chill in the fridge for an hour until set. Serve with fresh berries or a berry sauce.
