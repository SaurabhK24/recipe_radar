Ingredients

1 chicken breast, cut into 6 strips and marinated with 1 clove of chopped garlic, olive oil and chopped fresh thyme
1 egg yolk
1 lemon, juice only
1 anchovy
splash of cider vinegar
110g/4oz Cornish yarg, crumbled
olive oil
8 cherry tomatoes, brushed with the olive oil, thyme and garlic marinade
mixed leaves (eg: watercress, rocket, radicchio, and pousse)
flat-leaf parsley, chopped




Method


Sear the strips of chicken on a griddle pan. Then pan-fry the cherry tomatoes in the juices. In a mixing bowl place the egg, lemon juice, anchovy, yarg and vinegar.


Using a hand blender, slowly add enough olive oil to form a thick dressing. Pile up the leaves, lay the chicken on top, scatter the cherry tomatoes and pour on the dressing. Garnish with the parsley.
