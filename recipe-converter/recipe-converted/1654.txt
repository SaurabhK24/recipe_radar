Ingredients

2 large carrots, trimmed, cut into long, thin batons (these should resemble French fries in size and shape)
salt, to taste
50g/2oz ground almonds
30g/1¼oz parmesan, grated
1⁄2 tsp dried oregano
small pinch cayenne pepper
1 free-range egg, beaten




Method


Preheat the oven to 250C/220C Fan/Gas 9.


Season the carrot batons with salt.


In a large bowl, mix together the ground almonds, parmesan, oregano and cayenne pepper until well combined.


Dip each baton into the beaten egg, then dredge in the herb-and-spice mixture until evenly coated.


Arrange the carrot fries in a single layer on a baking tray. Bake for 10-12 minutes, turning during cooking, until tender and golden-brown all over. Serve hot.
