Ingredients

oil, for frying and brushing
1 red onion, sliced
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 red bird's-eye chilli, finely chopped
2 cooked chicken breasts, finely sliced
3 tomatoes, chopped
200g/7oz canned kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
8 crisp tortilla discs
200g/7oz Asiago or cheddar cheese, grated

To serve

1 avocado, peeled and chopped
4 tbsp sour cream
lime wedges




Method


Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the onion, garlic and chilli until softened.


Add the chicken, tomatoes and kidney beans and heat through thoroughly. Stir in the coriander.


Place four of the tortilla discs onto a baking sheet brushed with oil. Top each disc with some of the chicken mixture, then sprinkle over some of the cheese.


Top with another tortilla, followed by the remaining chicken mixture and cheese.


Preheat the grill to medium or preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Transfer the baking sheet to the oven or grill and cook for about five minutes, or until the tortillas are crisp and the cheese has melted, taking care not to burn the tortillas.


To serve, place a tortilla stack onto each of four plates and garnish with chopped avocado, a dollop of sour cream and some lime wedges.
