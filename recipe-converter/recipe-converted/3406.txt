Ingredients

600ml/1 pint full-fat milk
1 vanilla pod
3 eggs, yolks only
2 tsp cornflour
25g/1oz caster sugar




Method


Heat the milk with the vanilla pod until just boiling.


Mix together the egg yolks, sugar and cornflour to get a smooth paste.


Pour over the milk and stir well. Remove, wash and dry the vanilla pod to re-use in another recipe.


Strain the mixture back into a clean saucepan and, stirring constantly, cook gently until the custard thickens.
