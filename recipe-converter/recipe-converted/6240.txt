By Merrilees Parker






Ingredients

900g/2lb floury potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 tbsp sunflower oil
1 large onion, finely chopped
1 tsp Dijon mustard
½pint chicken stock (from a stock cube)
1 tsp gravy browning (optional)
8 pork sausages
50g/1½oz unsalted butter
50ml/2fl oz double cream or milk
1 tbsp each, fresh parsley and chives
3 spring onions, finely chopped
1 tbsp olive oil




Method


Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water for 10-12 minutes or until soft.


Heat the sunflower oil in a heavy-based saucepan. Add the onion and cook until soft , but not coloured. Stir in the mustard then pour in the stock. Bring the mixture to the boil, then add the gravy browning. Reduce for 10 minutes or until the liquid is reduced by half.


Heat up a frying pan, add a little sunflower oil and fry the sausages for 6-8 minutes or until cooked through.


Drain the potatoes and mash with the butter and the cream. Blend the blanched herbs with the olive oil to form a paste and then stir into the mashed potato.


Pile the mash onto four warmed serving plates. Place two sausages in the centre of each mound of mash and finally drizzle over the gravy.


Serve immediately.
