Ingredients

60ml/2¼fl oz olive oil
1 tsp fresh rosemary, finely chopped
200g/7¼oz sultanas
100g/3½oz raisins
100g/3½oz demerara sugar /or coconut sugar
400ml/14¼oz cider vinegar
100g/3½oz crystallised ginger, finely sliced
800g/1lb 12¼oz pears coared and cut into wedges
½ tsp sea salt
½ tsp nutmeg, freshly grated
2 tsp ground allspice
1 good pinch of saffron




Method


Heat a large saucepan with the oil, add the rosemary, sultanas, raisins and sugar and fry them until the fruit begins to caramelise.


Pour in the vinegar and boil on a high heat for three minutes. Then add the rest of the ingredients, bring to the boil, then turn to a simmer and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated. Because of the fruit, this chutney has a tendency to stick to the bottom of the pan, so stir it well and keep an eye on it. Don't let the pears cook too much; they should keep their shape.


Spoon it into clean hot jars, filling them as full as you can, and seal while hot. Store in the fridge.
