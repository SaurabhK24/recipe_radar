Ingredients
For the cake

250g/9oz dark chocolate (at least 70% cocoa solids)
250g/9oz unsalted butter
1 tbsp good-quality instant coffee
150g/5oz self-raising flour
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
80g/3oz cocoa powder
500g/1lb 2oz caster sugar
4 free-range eggs
2 tbsp sunflower oil
125ml/4fl oz milk
150g/5oz plain flour

For the butter icing

100g/3½oz chocolate (at least 70% cocoa solids)
50g/2oz unsalted butter
6 tbsp double cream
50g/2oz icing sugar




Method


Preheat the oven to 170C/340F/Gas 3½. Grease a 24cm/10in diameter cake tin and line it with baking paper.


For the cake, place the chocolate, butter and coffee into a bowl set over a pan simmering water, making sure the bowl does not touch the water.


Stir until melted and smooth then remove from the heat and set aside.


Mix together the flour, bicarbonate of soda and cocoa into a large bowl. Stir in the sugar and make a well in the middle.


Add the beaten eggs, oil and milk into the well and stir gently to combine all the ingredients.


Add the chocolate and butter mixture and stir to combine. The mixture will be wet and sloppy.


Pour into the prepared baking tin and cook for one hour or until firm.


Leave to cool completely before turning out of the tin.


For the icing, place all ingredients in a pan. Heat gently and stir until smooth.


Once cake and icing have cooled, spread the icing over the cake using a palette knife.
