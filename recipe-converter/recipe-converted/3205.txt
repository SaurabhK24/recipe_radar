Ingredients
For the crêpes

150g/7oz plain flour
2 free-range eggs
75ml/2½fl oz whole milk
75ml/2½fl oz double cream
½ clementine, juice only
25g/1oz butter

To serve

½ clementine, chopped
1 tbsp Greek yoghurt




Method


For the crêpes, place the flour, eggs, milk, double cream and clementine juice into a bowl and mix to make a smooth batter.


Heat half of the butter in a non-stick frying pan, place a ladleful of batter into the pan, swirl around to coat the base of the pan and cook for one minute on each side, or until golden-brown. Remove from the pan and repeat with the remaining mixture to make a second pancake.


To serve, place the pancakes onto a plate with the chopped clementine and a dollop of Greek yoghurt.
