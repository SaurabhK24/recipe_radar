Ingredients
For the chicken

1 boneless chicken thigh, skin removed, boned
55g/2oz cheddar cheese, sliced
3 rashers bacon
freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil

For the fresh herbed pasta

250ml/9fl oz double cream
1 garlic clove, crushed
handful each fresh chives, dill, parsley, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
125g/4½oz pasta bows, cooked according to packet instructions

For the sautéed broccoli

1 tbsp olive oil
25g/1oz butter
½ head broccoli, cut into florets
splash water




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.


For the chicken, stuff the chicken thigh with the cheese slices and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


Wrap the chicken in bacon rashers. Secure with a wooden skewer.


Heat the olive oil in an ovenproof frying pan, add the chicken and cook until it is brown on all sides. Place the frying pan into the oven and cook for 12 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.


For the pasta, put the cream and garlic into a saucepan and bring to the boil. As soon as it boils, remove from the heat, stir in the herbs and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add the cooked pasta and stir well.


For the broccoli, heat the olive oil and butter in a frying pan, add the broccoli and a splash of water and sauté for three minutes.


To serve, pile the pasta onto a serving plate or bowl, slice the chicken thigh into 3-4 vertical slices and place on top of the pasta. Serve with the sautéed broccoli on the side.
