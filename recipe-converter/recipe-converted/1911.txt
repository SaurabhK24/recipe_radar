Ingredients
For the chicory salad

1 tbsp olive oil
½ lemon, juice only
2 tbsp finely chopped fresh parsley
1 tbsp wholegrain mustard
4 radishes, grated
1 chicory head, shredded

For the cheese on toast

3 slices thick cut white bread, toasted
75g/2¾oz emmental cheese, grated
3 slices pastrami
3 slices cornichons
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


To make the salad, place the oil, lemon juice, fresh parsley, mustard and grated radish into a large bowl and whisk together.


Add the chicory, toss together to coat and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.


To make the cheese on toast, place the toasts onto a small baking tray. Place a layer of emmental cheese, a layer of pastrami and a layer of cornichons onto the toasts, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and place under the grill. Cook for three minutes, until the emmental has melted.


To serve, place the toasts on a large plate with the salad spooned alongside.
