Ingredients
For the pistachio-crusted monkfish

55g/2oz unsalted pistachio nuts, shells removed
1 tbsp plain flour
1 tsp sesame seeds
salt and freshly ground black pepper
125g/4½oz monkfish tail, de-boned and trimmed
25g/1oz butter
1 tbsp olive oil

For the crushed potatoes

100g/3½oz new potatoes, cut in half
25g/1oz butter
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives

For the sauce vierge

6 ripe cherry tomatoes
5 tbsp olive oil
handful fresh basil leaves, torn
½ lemon, juice only
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


For the monkfish, crush the pistachio nuts in a pestle and mortar. Place the crushed pistachios into a bowl with the flour, sesame seeds, salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix well.


Spread the mixture out on a baking sheet and roll the monkfish in the mixture to coat all over.


Heat the butter and oil in a frying pan and fry the fish until golden-brown and crisp on all sides, about 6-7 minutes.


Meanwhile, for the crushed potatoes, bring a pan of water to the boil and cook the potatoes until tender, about 10-12 minutes. Drain and crush using the back of a fork. Stir in the butter and the chives.


For the sauce vierge, heat all the ingredients in a pan until the tomatoes begin to break down.


To serve, cut the monkfish in half. Place the potatoes onto a serving plate, top with the monkfish and drizzle over the sauce.
