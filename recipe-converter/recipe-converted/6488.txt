Baked eggs are the perfect dish for a lazy brunch. If you like your eggs spicy just add a little chilli powder.

Ingredients

½ tbsp olive oil
½ onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, sliced
½ tsp ras-el-hanout
pinch ground cinnamon
½ tsp ground coriander
400g/14oz cherry tomatoes, chopped
2 tbsp chopped coriander
2 free-range eggs
salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.


Heat the oil in a frying pan, add the onion and garlic and cook for 6-7 minutes, or until soft. Stir in the spices and cook, stirring, for a further minute.


Add the tomatoes and season well with salt and pepper, then simmer gently for 8-10 minutes.


Scatter over 1 tablespoon of the coriander, then divide the tomato mixture between 2 individual ovenproof dishes. Break an egg into each dish.


Bake for 8-10 minutes until the egg whites are set but the yolks are still slightly runny. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes if you prefer the eggs to be cooked through.


Scatter over the remaining coriander and serve.




Recipe Tips
This dish would also make a great quick supper if served alongside a leafy green salad.
