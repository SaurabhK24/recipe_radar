Ingredients

100g/3½oz parmesan cheese (or vegetarian alternative), grated
10g fresh basil (about a handful) or 1 tbsp dried basil
10g fresh chives (about a handful) or 1 tbsp dried chives
½ tsp thyme leaves
250g/9oz self-raising flour
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
85ml/3fl oz sunflower oil
2 free-range eggs
100ml/3½fl oz semi-skimmed milk
100ml/3½fl oz low-fat natural yoghurt




Method


Wash and finely chop the herbs using a sharp knife or scissors.


Mix together the flour and bicarbonate of soda in a mixing bowl and add the parmesan and chopped herbs.


Measure the oil into the measuring jug.


Beat the eggs separately in a bowl then add to the oil.


Add the milk and yoghurt to the oil and egg mixture.


Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until combined.


Spoon the mixture into the six mugs, filling each one a third full.


Place three mugs in the microwave and cook for four minutes on full power, or until raised and firm to touch. You may need to adjust the timings slightly depending on the size and design of mug.


Repeat with the remaining mixture to make your second batch of muffins in a mug.


These muffins are delicious served warm, spooned out of the mug, or use a knife to score around the edge of the mug and tip the warm muffin out onto a cooling rack.
