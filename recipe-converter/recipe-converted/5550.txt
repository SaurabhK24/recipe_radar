Ingredients
For the lamb

200g/7oz lamb steak, fat trimmed and roughly chopped
½ small red onion, finely chopped
handful fresh mint, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp plain flour
2 tbsp olive oil

For the onions

1 tbsp olive oil
1 red onion, cut into rings
½ jar of marinated artichokes, drained
2 tbsp honey
½ tsp dried chilli flakes




Method


For the lamb, place the meat into a food processor with the onion and mint and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pulse to mix but not over blend to a paste.


Transfer the lamb mixture to a bowl and use the flour to bind and form into four patties. Place into the fridge yo chill while you make the onions.


For the onions, heat the oil in a small frying pan and add the onions. Cook gently for three minutes. Add the artichokes and continue to cook, covered for five minutes.


Add the honey and chilli flakes and cook uncovered over a high heat for three minutes.


Meanwhile heat the oil for the lamb in a frying pan. Add the lamb and cook for three minutes on each side, or until cooked through.


To serve, place the lamb onto a plate and top with the onions.
