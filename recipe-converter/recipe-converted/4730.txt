Ingredients
For the baked apple

50g/1¾oz unsalted butter
½ apple, core removed
1 tbsp cinnamon
1 tbsp brown sugar

For the sauce

2 tbsp brown sugar
½ tbsp cinnamon
50g/1¾oz unsalted butter
50ml/2fl oz double cream




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


For the baked apple, melt the butter in a small ovenproof frying pan. Add the apple, flesh-side down, and fry for two minutes.


Turn the apple over, sprinkle with the cinnamon and sugar, then transfer to the oven to bake for 10-12 minutes, until softened and cooked through.


To make the sauce, place the sugar, cinnamon and butter into a frying pan and heat for 3-4 minutes to caramelise.


Add the double cream and continue to heat to thicken the sauce.


To serve, place the baked apple in the centre of a warm plate and pour over the butterscotch cinnamon sauce.
