These cute vegetarian haggis stuffed mushrooms can serve as a starter or main course - just double up the recipe.



Ingredients

4 large flat open/Portobello mushrooms
1 tbsp olive oil
75g/2½ oz breadcrumbs
2 tbsp pine nuts, toasted
2 tbsp pecorino, grated
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
350g/12 oz vegetarian haggis, sliced




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Place the mushrooms onto a baking sheet and drizzle with a little oil. Cook in the oven for 5-6 minutes or until beginning to soften.


Mix together the breadcrumbs, pine nuts, pecorino and parsley.


Remove the mushrooms from under the grill and top each mushroom with a slice of vegetarian haggis.


Spoon the breadcrumb mixture over the haggis and drizzle with a little more oil.


Return to the oven for about 15 minutes or until the cheese is slightly melted and the filling is hot and bubbling.


Serve one mushroom as a starter or 2-3 with tatties and neeps as a main course.
