Method


Place the bulgar wheat in a mixing bowl and pour on the boiling water and soya sauce. Cover and let swell for 25 minutes.


Grind nuts and seeds to a medium fine consistency. Mix together with the wheat. Stir in the parsley, thyme, onions, eggs and oil. Mix well and allow to stand.


Oil a large baking sheet and line with greaseproof paper.


Form a loaf shape with the nut mixture, about 10cm/4in wide, press firmly together and prick the top with a fork.


Pour on a little oil and sprinkle with some extra nuts (optional) and cap loosely with a foil hood.


Bake in oven 190C/375F/Gas 5 for 40 minutes.


Take off hood, baste with oil on baking sheet and continue to bake for a further 10 minutes.


Place in a large serving dish, then cool, easing off the paper as you do so. Cover with the hood until ready to garnish.


To make the sauce cook all the ingredients, except the brandy, together for about 20 minutes. Add the brandy and re-heat for 30 seconds. Serve as an accompaniment to the main dish.
