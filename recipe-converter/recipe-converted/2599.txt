Ingredients

150g/5oz quality chocolate, preferably 70% or more cocoa solid content
150g/5oz ground almonds
2 tbsp double cream
75g/3oz caster sugar
1 tbsp rum
cocoa powder for rolling the truffles




Method


Place a saucepan of water on to boil. Break the chocolate into a heat proof bowl which should be big enough to sit and rest on the rim of the saucepan.


When the water boils remove the pan from the heat and then set the bowl of chocolate in the pan until the chocolate has melted.


Remove the bowl from the pan and stir in the ground almonds, cream, sugar and rum. Mix to a firm paste.


Work quickly, preferably with cool hands and roll the paste into small balls and then toss in the cocoa powder. Serve in sweet paper cases.
