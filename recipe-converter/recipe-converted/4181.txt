Ingredients

2 large sheets ready-made filo pastry
2 tsp vegetable oil
1 apple, peeled, cored and grated
50g/1¾oz sultanas
½ tsp cinnamon
½ tsp ground ginger
2 scoops vanilla ice cream




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Brush one side of each sheet of filo pastry with a little vegetable oil and press the oiled sides together; cut into two squares.


In a small bowl, mix together the apple, sultanas and spices.


Arrange a little of the apple mixture on one half of each filo square, so that the pastry can be folded over diagonally. Fold each over to make a triangular parcel, seal the edges and brush with more oil.


Put the triangles on a baking tray and cook for six minutes, until golden and cooked through.


Serve with a couple of scoops of vanilla ice cream.
