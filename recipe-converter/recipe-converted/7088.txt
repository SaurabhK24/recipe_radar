Ingredients

2 tbsp olive oil
100g/3½oz haddock, skin removed
1 tbsp lemon juice
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 red chilli, finely chopped
4 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
½ sweet potato, finely chopped
2 tbsp fresh peas
25g/1oz butter




Method


Bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil.


Heat the olive oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, add the haddock and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until cooked through.


Add the lemon, then season to taste with the salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add the chilli and parsley and fry for 1-2 minutes.


Add the chopped sweet potato to the boiling water and cook for 5-6 minutes. Add the peas and cook for 1-2 minutes longer, or until the peas have softened but are still firm, and the potatoes are tender.


Drain the cooked sweet potatoes and peas, and add them to the pan with the haddock. Stir in the butter and heat through for 2-3 minutes.


To serve, spoon the parsley and chilli sauce onto a serving plate and place the haddock on top.
