Ingredients
For the haddock

½ tsp chilli powder
½ tsp mixed spice
½ tsp paprika
salt and freshly ground black pepper
150g/5½oz fresh haddock fillet, cut into two pieces
1 tbsp olive oil
½ lemon, juice only

For the herb salad

1 handful mixed fresh parsley leaves, fresh basil and fresh chives
½ lemon
pinch chilli powder




Method


For the haddock, mix together the chilli powder, mixed spice, paprika, salt and freshly ground black pepper and rub the mixture into the fish.


Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and fry the haddock, skin-side down, for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Turn the fish over and cook for a further 1-2 minutes, or until the fish is golden-brown all over and cooked through. Finish with a squeeze of lemon juice.


To serve, place the mixed fresh herbs on a serving plate and place the fish on top. Garnish with the lemon half and a sprinkle of chilli powder.
