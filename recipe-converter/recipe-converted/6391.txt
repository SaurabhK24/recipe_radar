Ingredients

1 large white tortilla flatbread

Selection of toppings such as fresh basil, sliced peppers and shredded cooked chicken
30g/1oz mature cheddar, grated




Method


Preheat the oven to 170C/325F/Gas 3.


Use a 7cm/2Â¾in cookie cutter to cut six small circles out of the wrap and place on a baking tray.


Spoon a teaspoon of passata onto each circle and spread it to the edge. Sprinkle over some toppings and top with some grated cheese.


Bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is melted and golden-brown.
