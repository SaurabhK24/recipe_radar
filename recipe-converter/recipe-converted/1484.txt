Ingredients
For the filling

2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 onion, peeled, sliced
2 garlic cloves, peeled, chopped
2 leeks, trimmed, cut into large slices
200g/7oz cavolo nero or cabbage leaves, chopped
200g/7oz butternut squash flesh, cut into cubes, roasted in the oven in 1 tbsp oil for 15-20 minutes
1 x 440g/1lb can chopped tomatoes
1 tsp garam masala
1 tsp ground fenugreek
1 tsp curry powder
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the crumble

150g/5½oz plain flour
pinch salt
200g/7oz chilled butter, cut into cubes
150g/5½oz porridge oats

For the topping

150ml/5fl oz olive oil
small bunch basil leaves, torn
½ lemon, juice only




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until softened.


Add the leeks and cavolo nero or cabbage leaves and continue to fry for a further 3-4 minutes, or until wilted.


Add the roasted butternut squash, canned tomatoes and spices. Stir well, then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Continue to cook for a further 4-5 minutes, then spoon the mixture into an ovenproof dish. Set aside.


For the crumble, in a bowl, rub together all the crumble ingredients, using your fingertips, until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Sprinkle the crumble mixture on top of the filling mixture in an even layer.


Bake the crumble in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and the crumble is crisp and golden-brown.


Meanwhile, for the topping, blend the olive oil, basil and lemon juice in a food processor until well combined.


To serve, divide the butternut squash crumble equally among four serving plates. Drizzle over the topping.
