Tomato bredie is a South African stew flavoured with ginger, cardamom, cloves and chilli. Here goat steaks provide the meat, but you could use lamb or the traditional mutton.

Ingredients

12 peppercorns
2 cardamom pods
12 cloves
2 tbsp oil
2 large onions, sliced
100g/3½oz piece cooking chorizo
140ml/4½fl oz chicken stock
2 cinnamon sticks
2.5cm/1in root ginger, grated
1 green chilli, chopped
2 goats' leg steaks
680g/1½ lb new potatoes, halved lengthways
110g/4oz tomatoes, quartered
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper




Method


Tie up the peppercorns, cardamom pods and cloves in a muslin bag.


In a large pan heat one tablespoon of the oil and then fry the onions until golden-brown.


Roughly chop three-quarters of the chorizo and add to the pan.


Add the stock and bring to the boil. Add the cinnamon, ginger, chilli and the muslin spice bag.


Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a clean frying pan over a high heat. Colour the leg steaks well on all sides and then add to the stock pan. Cover with a lid and cook for 30 minutes.


In a clean pan of boiling water par-boil the potatoes.


Meanwhile, add the tomatoes to the meat pan and simmer for a further 15 minutes.


Add the potatoes to the meat pan and cook for another 30 minutes, or until the meat and potatoes are cooked.


Meanwhile, slice the remaining chorizo into circles and fry over a medium heat until well-coloured.


Stir the parsley into the stew and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Serve topped with the chorizo rings.
