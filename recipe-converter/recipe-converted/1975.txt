You don’t need an excuse to bake this fruity cake with a crumble topping. A generous slice goes perfectly with an afternoon cup of tea.

Ingredients
For the topping

75g/2¾oz plain flour
75g/2¾oz demerara sugar
1 tsp ground cinnamon
75g/2¾oz unsalted butter

For the cake

2 free-range eggs
150g/5½oz unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing
125g/4½oz caster sugar
125g/4½oz soured cream
250g/9oz plain flour
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
200g/7oz cherries, stones removed

For the glaze

125g/4½oz icing sugar
2-3 tbsp milk




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease and line a 20cm/8in springform cake tin.


For the topping, place the flour, sugar, cinnamon and butter into a bowl and, using your fingertips, rub the mixture together until it resembles breadcrumbs. Set aside.


For the cake, beat the eggs, butter and sugar in a bowl for five minutes with an electric whisk.


Stir in the soured cream, then fold in the flour, cinnamon, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda until well combined and smooth.


Spoon half of the mixture into the cake tin, top with the cherries, then the remaining cake mixture. Sprinkle over the topping.


Bake in the oven for 40-45 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.


Remove the cake from the oven and set aside to cool for 5 minutes.


For the glaze, whisk the icing sugar and two tablespoons of milk together in a bowl. (Add a little extra milk if the mixture is too thick.)


Spoon the glaze over the top of the cake and set aside for 10 minutes, or until the glaze hardens.




Recipe Tips
Use fresh cherries if you can get them, but use frozen or tinned when they’re not in season.
