Ingredients

115g/4oz butter, softened, plus extra for greasing
115g/4oz soft brown sugar
3 free-range eggs, beaten
115g/4oz self-raising flour
1 carrot, grated
1 tsp ground cinnamon
3 tbsp milk
85g/3oz icing sugar, plus extra to dust
splash water




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


In a bowl, cream the butter and brown sugar together until pale and fluffy. Gradually add the eggs and then fold in the flour, carrot and cinnamon. Finally stir in the milk.


Butter a 25cm/10in cake tin, pour in the cake mixture and smooth the surface. Place into the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until springy to touch on the top and a skewer comes out clean when inserted into the middle of the cake. Remove from the oven and leave to cool. Loosen the edges of the cake by running a sharp knife around the inside edge of the tin, then turn out onto a serving plate.


Place the icing sugar into a small bowl. Add a little water, a teaspoon at a time, and stir to make a thin icing. Drizzle the icing over the cake, cut into slices and serve.
