Flatbread is simple to make, quick to cook and tastes delicious served straight from the pan with dips.






By Patrick Ryan






Ingredients

250g/9oz strong bread flour, plus extra for dusting
½ tsp salt
½ tsp coriander seeds, toasted and ground
½ tsp smoked paprika
4 tbsp olive oil
100ml/3½fl oz warm water




Method


Mix the flour, salt, coriander seeds and paprika in a large bowl, make a well in the centre and add the olive oil and the warm water. Using a fork, start incorporating the flour with the water and olive oil, if necessary add more water. Once the dough starts to come together, use your hands to form a soft ball of dough.


Dust your hands and a clean work surface with flour and knead the dough for five minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic. Put the dough back into the bowl, cover and set aside for 15 minutes. (This dough is much firmer to handle than bread dough and will feel heavier.)


Divide the dough into five equal balls. Roll them out to the thickness of a £2 coin. Heat a griddle pan and cook the flat breads for two minutes on each side.


Serve immediately.




Recipe Tips
Versions of this recipe have been eaten around the world for centuries – roti, chapatti, tortilla, flat bread. They are made with different types of flour, but the principle is the same.
  The flat breads can be cooked on hot stones by an open fire, baked in the oven, or griddled.
