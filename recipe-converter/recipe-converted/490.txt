Ingredients
For the tomato topping

1 tbsp olive oil
¼ onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
100g/3½oz canned chopped tomatoes
pinch sugar
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the tapenade

100g/3½oz olives, stones removed
2 garlic cloves, chopped
1 lemon, zest only
2 tbsp capers, rinsed and drained
splash olive oil
freshly ground black pepper

For the bruschetta

2 tbsp olive oil
4 thick slices ciabatta
1 tbsp chopped fresh chives, to serve




Method


For the tomato topping, heat the oil in a pan, add the onion and cook gently until softened. Add the garlic and cook for one minute.


Add the tomatoes and a pinch of sugar and simmer for five minutes, or until the liquid has reduced and the sauce has thickened. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper and place into a small serving bowl.


For the tapenade, place all of the tapenade ingredients into a small food processor and blend until almost smooth. Place into a small serving bowl.


For the bruschetta, brush each slice of bread with olive oil. Heat a griddle pan until hot and griddle the bread until toasted on both sides.


To serve, place the toasted ciabatta onto a serving plate with the bowls of tapenade and tomato sauce alongside. Sprinkle with fresh chives.
