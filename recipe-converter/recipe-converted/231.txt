Ingredients
For the tempura vegetables

200g/7oz plain flour
200ml/7fl oz sparkling water
½ tsp salt
300ml/½ pint vegetable oil, for deep frying
1 small courgette, cut into batons
1 small carrot, cut into batons
4 chestnut mushrooms, halved

For the hot dipping sauce

2 tbsp soy sauce
½ tsp chilli flakes
1 lime, juice only
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
1 tbsp sparkling water
½ tsp caster sugar




Method


For the tempura vegetables, whisk the flour, water and salt together in a large bowl until it reaches the consistency of single cream, adding more water if necessary.


Pour the vegetable oil into a large saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread turns golden in 30 seconds. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Dip the vegetables in the batter and lower into the hot oil. Deep fry until golden-brown and crisp, about 4-5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


For the dipping sauce, place all the ingredients into a bowl and mix well.


To serve, pour the dipping sauce into a small bowl on a serving plate, surrounded by the tempura vegetables.
