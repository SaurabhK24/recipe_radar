Ingredients

30g/1¼oz butter, at room temperature
70g/2¾oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting
1 tsp golden caster sugar (optional)
20g/¾oz grated carrot
50g/2oz butternut squash pieces, roasted
3 small sprigs fresh rosemary




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.


In a bowl, mix together the butter, flour and sugar, if using. Rub the mixture with your fingertips until it resembles breadcrumbs.


Stir in the grated carrot and roasted butternut squash using a fork.


Bring the mixture together as a dough using your hands, then turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface.


Divide the dough into six equally sized pieces. Roll each piece into a sausage shape and place it onto a baking tray.


Flatten the lengths of cookie dough into carrot shapes about 0.5cm/¼in thick, using your hands.


Tear individual mini-sprigs off the rosemary sprigs and insert one into the top of each cookie to resemble the carrot tops.


Bake the cookies in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown. Remove from the baking tray and set aside to cool on a wire rack.




Recipe Tips
This is a good way to use up leftover roasted butternut squash.
