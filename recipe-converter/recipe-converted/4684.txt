Ingredients
For the grilled mushrooms

1 tbsp olive oil
2 Portobello mushrooms
100g/3½oz soft goats' cheese
1 sprig thyme, leaves only
2 tsp honey
freshly ground black pepper
½ garlic clove, finely sliced

For the beetroot and walnut salsa

4 small cooked beetroots, chopped
¼ onion, finely chopped
handful fresh parsley, chopped
2 tsp balsamic vinegar
2 tbsp olive oil

Method


Preheat the grill to medium.


For the grilled mushrooms, heat the olive oil in an ovenproof frying pan and fry the mushrooms on both sides for 2-3 minutes.


Divide the goats' cheese equally among the mushrooms and sprinkle over the thyme, honey, black pepper, garlic and walnuts. Place under the grill and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbling.


For the beetroot and walnut salsa, place all the salsa ingredients in a large bowl and mix well.
