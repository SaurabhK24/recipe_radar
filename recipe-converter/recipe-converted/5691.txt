Ingredients

1 x 25cm/10in sweet shortcrust pastry tart shell, baked blind (you can use ready-made pastry)

For the filling

300g/10½oz mascarpone
300g/10½oz caster sugar
6 lemons, juice and zest
6 free-range eggs, plus 6 free-range egg yolks

For the raspberry champagne sauce

175g/6oz caster sugar
150ml/5½fl oz champagne
200g/7oz fresh raspberries

To serve

icing sugar
raspberries
whipped cream




Method


Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.


Beat the mascarpone, caster sugar, lemon juice and zest together in a bowl until very smooth.


Beat in the eggs and egg yolks until well combined.


Pour the mixture into the tart shell and bake in the oven for 45-60 minutes, or until set. Remove the tart from the oven and set aside to cool, then leave to chill in the fridge.


For the sauce, bring the sugar and champagne to the boil in a saucepan, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, then add the raspberries and set aside to cool completely.


Blend the sauce in a blender until smooth, then pass through a sieve.


To serve, cut a slice of the tart, sprinkle over some icing sugar and caramelise with a cook’s blowtorch (optional).


Place the slice onto a serving plate and drizzle over a little sauce. Top with the raspberries and whipped cream.
