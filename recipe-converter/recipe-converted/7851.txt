Ingredients

40g/1¾oz dried porcini mushrooms
300ml/10½fl oz hot water from the kettle
250g/9oz chestnut mushrooms
150g/5oz chestnuts, cooked and peeled
1 x 400g/14oz tin flageolet beans, drained
100g/3½oz Macadamia nuts
1 free-range egg
3 tbsp honey
3 tbsp soy sauce
100g/3½oz breadcrumbs
2 tbsp groundnut oil, plus extra for greasing
200g/7oz kale




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Grease a baking tray with oil.


Soak the porcini mushrooms in the water in a small bowl for ten minutes.


Add the chestnut mushrooms, chestnuts, flageolet beans and macadamia nuts to a food processor. Blend for a short amount of time, until you have a rough paste with a little texture.


Drain the porcini, reserving the soaking liquid (use this for another dish, like mushroom risotto or soup). Add the porcini to the food processor and blend again.


Tip the contents of the food processor into a large bowl and mix in the egg, honey and soy sauce. Finally, add the breadcrumbs and stir well.


Shape into patties using your hands and place onto the oiled baking tray. Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes, but watch them carefully.


Meanwhile cook the kale in a covered pan with a few tablespoons of the reserved porcini stock for five minutes, or until tender.


Serve the nut roast patties with the kale alongside.
