Ingredients
For the aubergine

2 aubergines, cut into 2cm/1in cubes
180ml/6fl oz white miso
160g/5½oz caster sugar
50g/1¾oz clear honey

For the halibut

4 tbsp groundnut oil
4 x 150g-200g/5½-7oz fillets of halibut, skin on, pin boned
75g/2½oz unsalted butter

To serve

100g/3½oz edamame beans
4 tbsp white sesame seeds
4 tbsp black sesame seeds
4 tbsp Korean cayenne threads
2 tbsp mixed micro cress




Method


For the aubergine and edamame beans, half-fill a large saucepan or deep-fat fryer with the oil. Heat the oil to 180C, or until a 2cm/1in cube of bread dropped into the oil turns golden-brown and crisp within 1 minute. (CAUTION: do not leave hot oil unattended.)


Deep-fry the diced aubergine for 2-3 minutes or until golden-brown and crisp. Set aside to drain on kitchen roll.


In a saucepan, heat the white miso, sugar, honey and 100ml/3½fl oz water. Cook until it has reduced in volume and turned golden-brown.


For the halibut, heat a large frying pan and add the oil. Once hot add the fish skin-side down and cook for 2-3 minutes, turn over and cook for a further 2-3 minutes.


Just before serving add the butter and baste the fish. Allow the fish to rest before serving.


To serve, place the diced aubergine onto a serving plate and spoon over the sauce. Place the fish in the centre and garnish with the edamame beans, sesame seeds, cayenne threads and micro cress.
