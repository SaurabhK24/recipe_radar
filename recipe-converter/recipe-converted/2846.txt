2 x 100g/3½oz red mullet fillets, pin boned and diced
12 prawns, shells removed
12 langoustines, shells removed, blanched
2 tbsp Dijon mustard
200g/7oz flaked almonds, crushed
2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped

For the roasted red pepper sauce

1 slice sourdough bread, cut into cubes
½ red chilli, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
50ml/2fl oz extra virgin olive oil
3 plum tomatoes
100g/½oz flaked almonds, toasted
½ tbsp smoked Spanish paprika
½ jar roasted red peppers
1 lemon, juice only
lemon wedges
salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the nibbles (optional)

Method


For the seafood, heat a deep-fat fryer to 180C. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)


Brush the fish and seafood with the Dijon mustard. Season with salt and pepper. Mix the crushed flaked almonds and chopped parsley together, then press onto the fish and seafood to coat.


Place in the deep-fat fryer and cook for 2-3 minutes, depending on the size of the seafood. Remove using a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper.


For the roasted red pepper sauce, gently fry the bread, chilli and garlic in a pan with a little oil until the bread begins to colour.


Transfer the pan contents to a blender. Add the tomatoes, almonds, smoked paprika and peppers. Purée the mixture then add the lemon juice and a little olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.


To serve, place the sauce on a serving platter and put the fish, prawns and langoustines on top. Serve the nibbles alongside.
