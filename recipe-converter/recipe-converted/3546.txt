These easy, homemade lollies are perfect for beating the heat during the kids' school holidays.





By Kate Morris and Sally Brown


From I Can Cook on the Go






Ingredients

4 drops vanilla extract
1 tsp runny honey
135g/1½oz Greek-style yoghurt
25g/1oz fresh raspberries, mashed
50g/2oz fresh strawberries, mashed




Method


In a bowl, mix the vanilla extract and honey into the yoghurt. Stir in the fruit and fruit juices with a spatula to create a swirling pattern.


Divide the mixture equally among four lollipop moulds. Cover with the lids or with aluminium foil.


Freeze the disco pops for 1-2 hours.




Recipe Tips
Tip: If you don't have any lollipop moulds, use empty, cleaned yoghurt pots. Once you have covered the pots with aluminium foil, pierce each foil covering with a lollipop stick and push until the stick reaches the base of the pot.
