Ingredients

flour, for dusting
100g/3½oz puff pastry
2 apricots, halved, stones removed
2 tbsp sultanas
1 free-range egg, beaten

To serve

icing sugar, to dust
1 tbsp Greek-style yoghurt
fresh mint leaves, to garnish




Method


Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and lightly flour a clean surface.


Roll the puff pastry out on the lightly floured surface to the thickness of a pound coin, then cut into a boat shape.


Place on a non-stick baking sheet, top with the apricot halves and sultanas and brush around the edges of the pastry with the beaten egg.


Transfer to the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes, or until puffed up and golden-brown.


To serve, place the pastry onto a serving plate and dust with icing sugar. Top with a dollop of Greek-style yoghurt and garnish with mint leaves.
