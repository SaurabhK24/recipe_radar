Ingredients

2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve
2 red onions cut into wedges
2 courgettes, chopped into 1cm/½in batons
150g/5½oz celeriac, cut into cubes
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
2 tbsp tomato purée
1 tbsp smoked paprika
1 x 440g/1lb tin chopped tomatoes
200ml/7fl oz vegetable stock
1 x 400g/14oz tin butter beans or mixed beans, drained
handful fresh basil
1 lemon, zest only
100g/3½oz cooked broad beans

For the griddled potato cakes

250g/9oz mashed potatoes
1 tsp baking powder
100g/3½oz plain flour
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp fresh thyme
2 tbsp vegetable oil




Method


For the stew, heat two tablespoons of the oil in a casserole pan and fry the onions, courgettes, celeriac and garlic for 4-5 minutes.


Add the tomato purée and smoked paprika and cook for a further 4-5 minutes. Add the chopped tomatoes and stock, bring to boil, then reduce to a simmer for 20-25 minutes.


Stir in the butter beans, basil and lemon zest and cook for a further 10 minutes, then stir in the broad beans. Finish the stew with a good glug of extra-virgin olive oil.


Meanwhile, for the griddled potato cakes, mix the ingredients together in a bowl until well combined, then shape the potato mixture into six patties.


Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the patties for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until crisp and golden-brown on both sides.


To serve, ladle the stew into serving bowl and serve the potato cakes alongside.




Recipe Tips
You can buy readymade mashed potato from the chiller and freezer sections of most supermarkets, which will make the potato cakes much quicker to make.
